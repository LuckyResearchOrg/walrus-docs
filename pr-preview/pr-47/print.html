<p>Welcome to the developer documentation for Walrus, a decentralized storage and availability protocol
designed specifically for large binary files, or "blobs". Walrus focuses on providing a robust
solution for storing unstructured content on decentralized storage nodes while ensuring high
availability and reliability even in the presence of Byzantine faults.</p>
<h2 id="features"><a class="header" href="#features">Features</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage and retrieval</strong>: Walrus supports storage operations to write and read blobs. It also
allows anyone to prove that a blob has been stored and is available for retrieval at a later
time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost efficiency</strong>: By utilizing advanced error correction coding, Walrus maintains storage
costs at approximately five times the size of the stored blobs and encoded parts of each blob
are stored on each storage node. This is significantly more cost-effective compared to
traditional full replication methods and much more robust against failures compared to
protocols that only store each blob on a subset of storage nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integration with Sui blockchain</strong>: Walrus leverages the <a href="https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui">Sui</a>
for coordination, attesting availability and payments. Storage space can be owned as a resource on
Sui, split, merged, and transferred. Blob storage is represented using storage objects on Sui, and
smart contracts can check whether a blob is available and for how long.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexible access</strong>: Users can interact with Walrus through a command-line interface (CLI),
software development kits (SDKs), and web2 HTTP technologies. Walrus is designed to work well
with traditional caches and content distribution networks (CDNs), while ensuring all operations
can also be run using local tools to maximize decentralization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="architecture-and-operations"><a class="header" href="#architecture-and-operations">Architecture and operations</a></h2>
<p>Walrus's architecture ensures that content remains accessible and retrievable even when many
storage nodes are unavailable or malicious. Under the hood it uses modern error correction
techniques based on fast linear fountain codes, augmented to ensure resilience against Byzantine
faults, and a dynamically changing set of storage nodes. The core of Walrus remains simple, and
storage node management and blob certification leverages Sui smart contracts.</p>
<p>This documentation is split into several parts. The first part provides an overview of the
objectives, security properties, and architecture of the Walrus system. The second part contains
concrete documentation on the usage of Walrus. At the end, we provide a <a href="./glossary.html">glossary</a>,
which defines key terms used throughout the project.</p>
<p>Walrus is architected to provide a reliable and cost-effective solution for large-scale blob
storage, making it an ideal choice for applications requiring decentralized, affordable, durable,
and accessible data storage.</p>
<h2 id="sources"><a class="header" href="#sources">Sources</a></h2>
<p>This documentation is built using <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/">mdBook</a> from source files in
<a href="https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-docs/">github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-docs/</a>. Please report or
fix any errors you find in this documentation in that GitHub project.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="objectives-and-use-cases"><a class="header" href="#objectives-and-use-cases">Objectives and use-cases</a></h1>
<p>Walrus supports operations to store and retrieve blobs, and to prove and verify their availability.
It ensures content survives storage nodes suffering Byzantine faults and remains available and
retrievable. It provides APIs to access the stored content over a CLI, SDKs and over web2 HTTP
technologies, and supports content delivery infrastructures like caches and content distribution
networks (CDNs).</p>
<p>Under the hood, storage cost is a small fixed multiple of the size of blobs (around 5x) thanks to
advanced error correction coding, in contrast to the full replication of data traditional to
blockchains such as &gt;100x for data stored in Sui objects. As a result much bigger resources, up to
several GiB, may be stored on Walrus at substantially lower cost compared to Sui or other
blockchains. Since encoded blobs are stored on all storage nodes Walrus also provides superior
robustness compared with designs with a small amount of replicas storing the full blob.</p>
<p>Walrus uses the Sui chain for coordination and payments. Available storage is represented as Sui
objects that can be acquired, owned, split, merged and transferred. Storage space can be tied to
a stored blob for a period of time. And the resulting Sui object may be used to prove
availability on chain in smart contracts, or off chain using light clients.</p>
<p>In the <a href="overview/./overview.html">next chapter</a> we discuss in details the above operations relating to storage,
retrieval and availability.</p>
<p>In the future, we plan to include in Walrus some minimal governance to allow storage nodes to
change between storage epochs. Walrus is also compatible with periodic payments for continued
storage. We also plan to implement storage attestation based on challenges to get confidence that
that blobs are stored or at least available. Walrus also allows light-nodes that store small parts
of blobs to get rewards for proving availability and assisting recovery. We will cover these
topics in later documents. We also provide details of the encoding scheme in a separate document.</p>
<h2 id="non-objectives"><a class="header" href="#non-objectives">Non-objectives</a></h2>
<p>There are a few things that Walrus explicitly is not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walrus does not reimplement a CDN that might be geo-replicated or have less than tens of
milliseconds of latency. Instead, it ensures that traditional CDNs are usable and compatible with
Walrus caches.</li>
<li>Walrus does not re-implement a full smart contracts platform with consensus or execution. It
relies on Sui smart contracts when necessary, to manage Walrus resources and processes including
payments, storage epochs etc.</li>
<li>Walrus supports storage of any blob including encrypted blobs, however Walrus itself is not the
distributed key management infrastructure that manages and distributed encryption or decryption
keys to support a full private storage eco-system. It can however provide the storage layer of for
such infrastructures.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="use-cases"><a class="header" href="#use-cases">Use-cases</a></h2>
<p>App builders may use Walrus in conjunction with Sui to build experiences that require large
amounts of  data to be stored in a decentralized manner and possibly certified as available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storage of media for NFT or dapps</strong>: Walrus can directly store and serve media such as images,
sounds, sprites, videos, other game assets, etc. This is publicly available media that can be
accessed using HTTP requests at caches to create multimedia dapps.</li>
<li><strong>AI related use cases</strong>: Walrus can store clean data sets of training data, datasets with a
known and verified provenance, models weights, and proofs of correct training for AI models.
Or it may be used to store and ensure the availability of an AI model output.</li>
<li><strong>Storage of long term archival of blockchain history</strong>: Walrus can be used as a lower cost
decentralized store to store blockchain history. For Sui this can include sequences of
checkpoints with all associated transaction and effects content. As well as historic snapshots
of the blockchain state, code or binaries.</li>
<li><strong>Support availability for L2s</strong>: Walrus allows parties to certify the availability of blobs, as
required by L2s that need data to be stored and be attested as available to all. This may also
include availability of extra audit data such as validity proofs, zero knowledge proofs of
correct execution or large fraud proofs.</li>
<li><strong>Support a full decentralized web experience</strong>: Walrus can host full decentralized web
experiences including all resources (such as js, css, html, media). These can provide content but
also host the UX of dapps to build dapps with fully decentralized front end and back ends on
chain. It brings the full "web" back in "web3".</li>
<li><strong>Support subscription models for media</strong>: Creators can store encrypted media on Walrus and only
provide access via decryption keys to parties that have paid a subscription fee or have paid for
contents. (Note that Walrus provides the storage, encryption and decryption needs to happen off
Walrus).</li>
</ul>

<p>The key actors in the Walrus architecture are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Users</strong> through <strong>clients</strong> want to store and read <strong>blobs</strong> identified by their <strong>blob ID</strong>.
They are ready to pay for service
when it comes to writes, and when it comes to non-best-effort reads. Users also want to prove
the <strong>availability</strong> of a blob to third parties without the cost of sending or receiving the full
blob. Users may be malicious in various ways: they may wish to not pay for services, prove the
availability of an unavailable blobs, or modify / delete blobs without authorization, try to
exhaust resources of storage nodes, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Storage nodes</strong> hold one or many <strong>shards</strong> within a <strong>storage epoch</strong>. Each blob is erasure
encoded in many <strong>slivers</strong> and slivers from each stored blob become part of all shards. A shard
at any storage epoch is associated with a <strong>storage node</strong> that actually stores all slivers of
the shard, and is ready to serve them. The assignment of storage nodes to shards within
<strong>storage epochs</strong> is controlled by a Sui smart contract and we assume that more than 2/3 of the
shards are managed by correct storage nodes within each storage epoch. This means that we must
tolerate up to 1/3 of the shards managed by Byzantine storage nodes (approximately 1/3 of the
storage nodes being Byzantine) within each storage epoch and across storage epochs.</li>
<li>All clients and storage nodes operate a <strong>blockchain</strong> client (specifically on Sui), and mediate
payments, resources (space), mapping of shards to storage nodes, and metadata through blockchain
smart contracts. Users interact with the blockchain to acquire storage resources and upload
certificates for stored blobs. Storage nodes listen to the blockchain events to coordinate
their operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Walrus supports any additional number of optional infrastructure actors that can operate in a
permissionless way:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Caches</strong> are <strong>clients</strong> that store one or more full blobs and make them available to users
over traditional web2 (HTTP, etc) technologies. They are optional in that end-users may also
operate a local cache, and perform Walrus reads over web2 technologies locally. However, cache
infrastructures may also act as CDNs, split the cost of blob reconstruction over many requests,
be better connected, etc. A client can always verify that reads from such infrastructures
are correct.</li>
<li><strong>Publishers</strong> are <strong>clients</strong> that help end users store a blob using web2 technologies,
using less bandwidth and custom logic. They in effect receive the blob to be published over
traditional web2 protocols (e.g., HTTP) and run the Walrus store protocol on the end-user's
behalf. This includes encoding the blob into slivers, distributing the slivers to shards,
collecting storage-node signatures and aggregating them into a certificate, as well as all
other on-chain actions. They are optional in that a user may directly interact with Sui and
the storage nodes to store blobs. An end user can always verify that a publisher
performed their duties correctly by checking that an event associated with the
<a href="overview/./properties.html">Point of Availability</a> for the blob exists on-chain
and then either performing a read to see if Walrus returns the blob or by encoding the blob
and comparing the result to the blob ID in the certificate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Caches, publishers, and end-users are not considered trusted components of the system, and they may
deviate from the protocol arbitrarily. However, some of the security properties of Walrus only hold
for honest end-users that use honest intermediaries (caches and publishers). We provide means for
end-users to audit the correct operation of both caches and publishers.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="encoding-overheads-and-verification"><a class="header" href="#encoding-overheads-and-verification">Encoding, overheads, and verification</a></h1>
<p>We summarize here the basic encoding and cryptographic techniques used in Walrus.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storage nodes</strong> hold one or many <strong>shards</strong> in a storage epoch, out of a larger total (say 1000)
and each shard contains one blob <strong>sliver</strong> for each blob past PoA. Each shard is assigned to a
storage node in a storage epoch.</li>
<li>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_codes">erasure code</a> <strong>encode algorithm</strong> takes a blob,
and encodes it as K symbols, such that any fraction p of symbols can be used to reconstruct
the blob. Each blob sliver contains a fixed number of such symbols.</li>
<li>We select p &lt; 1/3 so that a third of symbols and also slivers may be used to reconstruct the blob
by the <strong>decode algorithm</strong>. The matrix used to produce the erasure code is fixed and the same
for all blobs by the Walrus system, and encoders have no discretion about it.</li>
<li>Storage nodes manage one or more shards, and corresponding slivers of each blob are distributed
to all the storage shards. As a result, the overhead of the distributed store is ~5x that of
the blob itself, no matter how many shards we have. The encoding is systematic meaning that some
storage nodes hold part of the original blob, allowing for fast random access reads.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each blob is also associated with some metadata including a blob ID to allow verification:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>blob ID</strong> is computed as an authenticator of the set of all shard data and metadata (byte
size,
encoding, blob hash). We hash a sliver representation in each of the shards and add the resulting
hashes into a Merkle tree. Then the root of the Merkle tree is the blob hash used to derive the
blob ID that identifies the blob in the system.</li>
<li>Each storage node may use the blob ID to check if some shard data belongs to a blob using the
authenticated structure corresponding to the blob hash (Merkle tree). A successful check means
that the data is indeed as intended by the writer of the blob (who, remember, may be corrupt).</li>
<li>When any party reconstructs a blob ID from shard slivers, or accepts any blob claiming
to be a specific blob ID, it must check that it encodes to the correct blob ID. This process
involves re-coding the blob using the erasure correction code, and re-deriving the blob ID to
check the blob indeed matches. This prevents a malformed blob (i.e., incorrectly erasure coded)
from ever being read as a valid blob at any correct recipient.</li>
<li>A set of slivers equal to the reconstruction threshold belonging to a blob ID that are either
inconsistent or lead to the reconstruction of a different ID represent an incorrect encoding
(this can only happen if the user that encoded the blob was malicious and encoded it incorrectly).
We can extract one symbol per sliver to form an inconsistency proof.
Storage nodes may delete slivers belonging to inconsistently encoded blobs,
and upon request return either the inconsistency proof or an inconsistency certificate posted
on-chain.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="operations"><a class="header" href="#operations">Operations</a></h1>
<p>Walrus operations can be separated in <a href="overview/./operations-sui.html">interactions with the Sui chain</a>, which
is used by Walrus for coordination and governance, and <a href="overview/./operations-off-chain.html">off-chain
interactions</a> between clients and storage nodes.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="operations-on-sui"><a class="header" href="#operations-on-sui">Operations on Sui</a></h1>
<p>Walrus uses Sui smart contracts to coordinate storage operations as resources that have a lifetime,
and payments. As well as to facilitate governance to determine the storage nodes holding each
storage shard. We outline here these operations and refer to them below as part of the read / write
paths. As a reminder, only blob metadata is ever exposed to Sui or its validators, and the content
of blobs is always stored off-chain on Walrus storage nodes and caches. The storage nodes or caches
do not have to overlap with any Sui infra (validators etc), and the storage epochs may be of
different lengths and not have the same start / end times as Sui epochs.</p>
<h2 id="storage-resource-life-cycle-on-sui"><a class="header" href="#storage-resource-life-cycle-on-sui">Storage resource life cycle on Sui</a></h2>
<p>A number of Sui smart contracts hold the metadata of the Walrus system and all its entities.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>Walrus system object</strong> holds the committee of storage nodes for the current storage epoch. The
system object also holds the total available space on Walrus and the price per unit of storage (1
KiB). These values are determined by 2/3 agreement between the storage nodes for the storage
epoch. Users can pay to purchase storage space for some time duration. These space resources may
be split, merged and transferred. Later they can be used to place a blob ID into Walrus.</li>
<li>The <strong>storage fund</strong> holds funds for storing blobs over one, multiple storage epochs or
perpetually. When purchasing storage space from the system object users pay into the storage fund
separated over multiple storage epochs, and payments are made each epoch to storage nodes
according to performance (see below).</li>
<li>A user acquires some storage through the contracts or transfer, and can assign to it a blob ID,
signifying they wish to store this blob ID into it. This emits a Move <strong>resource event</strong> that
both caches and storage nodes listen to to expect and authorize off-chain storage operations.</li>
<li>Eventually a user holds an off-chain <strong>availability certificate</strong> from storage nodes for a blob
ID. The user <strong>uploads the certificate on chain</strong> to signal that the blob ID is available for an
availability period. The certificate is checked against the latest Walrus committee,
and an <strong>availability event</strong> is emitted for the blob ID if correct. This is the PoA for the
blob.</li>
<li>At a later time a certified blob's storage may be <strong>extended</strong> by adding a storage object to it
with a longer expiry period. This facility may be used by smart contracts to extend the
availability of blobs stored in perpetuity as long as funds exist to continue providing storage.</li>
<li>In case a blob ID is not correctly encoded a <strong>inconsistency proof certificate</strong> may be uploaded
on chain at a later time, and an <strong>inconsistent blob event</strong> is emitted signaling to all that the
blob ID read results will always return None. This indicates that its slivers may be deleted by
storage nodes, except for an indicator to return None.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users writing to Walrus, need to perform Sui transactions to acquire storage and certify blobs.
Users creating or consuming proofs for attestations of blob availability read the chain
only to prove or verify emission of events. A node that reads Walrus resources only needs to read
the blockchain to get committee metadata once per epoch, and then they request slivers directly
from storage nodes by blob ID to perform reads.</p>
<h2 id="governance-operations-on-sui"><a class="header" href="#governance-operations-on-sui">Governance operations on Sui</a></h2>
<p>Each Walrus storage epoch is represented by the Walrus system object that contains a storage
committee and various metadata or storage nodes like the mapping between shards and storage nodes,
available space and current costs. User may go to the system object for the period and <strong>buy some
storage</strong> amount for one or more storage epochs. At each storage epoch there is a price for storage,
and the payment provided becomes part of a <strong>storage fund</strong> for all the storage epochs that span
the storage bought. There is a maximum number of storage epochs in the future for which storage can
be bought (~2 years). Storage is a resource that can be split, merged, and transferred.</p>
<p>At the end of the storage epoch part of the funds in the <strong>storage fund need to be allocated to
storage nodes</strong>. The idea here is for storage nodes to perform light audits of each others,
and suggest which nodes are to be paid based on the performance of these audits.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="off-chain-operations"><a class="header" href="#off-chain-operations">Off-chain operations</a></h1>
<p>Walrus operations happen off Sui, but may interact with the Sui flows defining the resource life
cycle.</p>
<h2 id="write-paths"><a class="header" href="#write-paths">Write paths</a></h2>
<p><img src="overview/../assets/WriteFlow.png" alt="Write paths of Walrus" /></p>
<p>Systems overview of writes, illustrated above:</p>
<ul>
<li>A user acquires a storage resource of appropriate size and duration on-chain, either by directly
buying it on the Walrus system object, or a secondary market. A user can split, merge, and
transfer owned storage resources.</li>
<li>When a user wants to write a blob, it first erasure codes it using encode, and computes the
blob ID. Then they can perform the following steps themselves, or use a publisher to perform steps
on their behalf.</li>
<li>The user goes on chain (Sui) and updates a storage resource to register the blob ID with the
desired size and lifetime. This emits an event, received by storage nodes. Once the
user receives they then continue the upload.</li>
<li>The user sends each of the blob slivers and metadata to the storage nodes that currently
manages the corresponding shards.</li>
<li>A storage node managing a shard receives a sliver and checks it against the blob ID.
It also checks that there is a blob resource with the blob ID that is authorized to store
a blob. If correct, then the storage node signs a statement that it holds the sliver for blob ID
(and metadata) and returns it to the user.</li>
<li>The user puts together the signatures returned from storage nodes into an availability certificate
and sends it on chain. When the certificate is verified on-chain an availability event for the
blob ID is emitted, and all other storage nodes seek to download any missing shards for the blob
ID. This event emitted by Sui is the <a href="overview/./properties.html">Point of Availability (PoA)</a> for the blob
ID.</li>
<li>After the PoA, and without user involvement, storage nodes sync and recover any missing slivers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The user waits for 2/3 of shard signatures to return in order to create the certificate of
availability. The rate of the code is below 1/3 allowing for reconstruction even if only 1/3 of
shards return the sliver for a read. Since at most 1/3 of the storage nodes can fail, this ensures
reconstruction if a reader requests slivers from all storage nodes. Note that the full process can
be mediated by a publisher, that receives a blob and drives the process to completion.</p>
<h2 id="refresh-availability"><a class="header" href="#refresh-availability">Refresh availability</a></h2>
<p>Since no content data is required to refresh the duration of storage, refresh is conducted fully on
chain within the protocol. To request an extension to the availability of a blob, a user
provides an appropriate storage resource. Upon success this emits an event that storage nodes
receive to extend the time for which each sliver is stored.</p>
<h2 id="inconsistent-resource-flow"><a class="header" href="#inconsistent-resource-flow">Inconsistent resource flow</a></h2>
<p>When a correct storage node tries to reconstruct a shard it may fail if the encoding of a blob ID
past <a href="overview/./properties.html">PoA</a> was incorrect, but will instead extract an inconsistency proof for the
blob ID. It will then use the proof to create a inconsistency certificate and upload it on chain.
The flow is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A storage node fails to reconstruct a shard, and instead holds an inconsistency proof.</li>
<li>The storage node sends the blob ID and inconsistency proof to all storage nodes of the Walrus
epoch. The storage node verify the proof and sign it.</li>
<li>The storage node aggregate the signatures into an inconsistency certificate and sends it to the
Walrus smart contract, that verifies it and emits a inconsistent resource event.</li>
<li>Upon receiving an inconsistent resource event, correct storage nodes delete sliver data for the
blob ID and record in the metadata to return None for the blob ID for the
<a href="overview/./properties.html">availability period</a>. No storage attestation challenges are issued for this
blob ID.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that a blob ID that is inconsistent will always resolve to None upon reading: this is because
the read process re-encodes the received blob to check that the blob ID is correctly derived from a
consistent encoding. This means that an inconsistency proof only reveals a true fact to storage
nodes (that do not otherwise ran decoding), and does not change the output of read in any case.</p>
<p>Note however that partial reads leveraging the systematic nature of the encoding may return partial
reads for inconsistently encoded files. Thus if consistency and availability of reads is important
dapps should do full reads rather than partial reads.</p>
<h2 id="read-paths"><a class="header" href="#read-paths">Read paths</a></h2>
<p>A user can read stored blobs either directly or through a cache. We discuss here the direct user
journey since this is also how the cached operates in case of a cache miss. We assume that most
reads will happen through caches, for blobs that are hot, and will not result in requests to
storage nodes.</p>
<ul>
<li>The reader gets the metadata for the blob ID from any storage node, and authenticates it using
the blob ID.</li>
<li>The reader then sends a request to the storage node for the shards corresponding to the blob ID,
and waits for f+1 to respond. Sufficient requests are sent in parallel to ensure low latency for
reads.</li>
<li>The reader authenticates the slivers returned with the blob ID, reconstructs the blob, and decides
whether the contents are a valid blob or inconsistent.</li>
<li>Optionally, for a cache, the result is cached and can be served without reconstruction until it is
evicted from the cache. Requests for the blob to the cache return the blob contents, or a proof
the blob is inconsistently encoded.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="challenge-mechanism-for-storage-attestation"><a class="header" href="#challenge-mechanism-for-storage-attestation">Challenge mechanism for storage attestation</a></h2>
<p>During an epoch a correct storage node challenges all shards to provide blob slivers past PoA:</p>
<ul>
<li>The list of available blobs for the epoch is determined by the sequence of Sui events up
to the past epoch. Inconsistent blobs are not challenged, and a record proving this status
can be returned instead.</li>
<li>A challenge sequence is determined by providing a seed to the challenged shard. The sequence is
then computed based both on the seed AND the content of each challenged blob ID. This creates a
sequential read dependency.</li>
<li>The response to the challenge provides the sequence of shard contents for the blob IDs in a
timely manner.</li>
<li>The challenger node uses thresholds to determine whether the challenge was passed, and reports
the result on chain.</li>
<li>The challenge / response communication is authenticated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Challenges provide some reassurance that the storage node actually can recover shard data in a
probabilistic manner, avoiding storage nodes getting payment without any evidence they may retrieve
shard data. The sequential nature of the challenge and some reasonable timeout also ensure that
the process is timely.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="walrus-assurance-and-security-properties"><a class="header" href="#walrus-assurance-and-security-properties">Walrus assurance and security properties</a></h1>
<p>The properties below hold true subject to the assumption that for all storage epochs 2/3 of shards
are operated by storage nodes that faithfully and correctly follow the Walrus protocol.</p>
<p>Each blob is encoded using error correction into slivers and a <strong>blob ID</strong> is cryptographically
derived. For a given blob ID there is a <strong>point of availability</strong> (PoA) and an <strong>availability
period</strong>, observable through an event on the Sui chain.</p>
<p>The following properties relate to the PoA:</p>
<ul>
<li>After the PoA, for a blob ID, any correct user that performs a read within the availability
period will eventually terminate and get a value V which is either the blob contents F or None.</li>
<li>After PoA if two correct users perform a read and get V and V’ then V = V’.</li>
<li>A correct user with an appropriate storage resource can always perform store for a blob F with a
blob ID and advance the protocol until the PoA.</li>
<li>A read after PoA for a blob F stored by a correct user, will result in F.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some assurance properties ensure the correct internal processes of Walrus storage nodes.
For the purposes of defining these, an <strong>inconsistency proof</strong> proves that a blob ID was
stored by a user that incorrectly encoded a blob.</p>
<ul>
<li>After PoA and for a blob ID stored by a correct user, a storage node is always able to recover
the correct sliver for its shards for this blob ID.</li>
<li>After PoA if a correct storage node cannot recover a sliver, it can produce an inconsistency proof
for the blob ID.</li>
<li>If a blob ID is stored by a correct user, an inconsistently proof cannot be derived for it.</li>
<li>A read by a correct user for a blob ID for which an inconsistency proof may exist returns None.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that there is no delete operation and a blob ID past PoA will be available for the full
availability period.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb: before PoA it is the responsibility of a client to ensure the availability of
a blob and its upload to Walrus. After PoA it is the responsibility of Walrus as a system to
maintain the availability of the blob as part of its operation for the full availability period
remaining. Emission of the event corresponding to the PoA for a blob ID attests its
availability.</p>

<p>In this document, we left out details of the following features:</p>

to allow this operation to be efficient. A storage node needs to only get data of the same
magnitude to the missing sliver data to reconstruct them.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="components"><a class="header" href="#components">Components</a></h1>
<p>From a developer perspective, some Walrus components are objects and smart contracts on
Sui, and some components are Walrus-specific binaries and services. As a rule Sui is used to
manage blob and storage node metadata, while Walrus-specific services are used to store and
read blob contents, which can be very large.</p>
<p>Walrus defines a number of objects and smart contracts on Sui:</p>
<ul>
<li>A shared <em>system object</em>, records and manages the current committee of storage nodes.</li>
<li><em>Storage resources</em>, represent empty storage space that may be used to store blobs.</li>
<li><em>Blob resources</em>, represent blobs being registered and certified as stored.</li>
<li>Changes to these objects emit <em>Walrus-related events</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Walrus system object ID can be found in the Walrus <code>client_config.yaml</code> file
(see <a href="dev-guide/../usage/configuration.html">Configuration</a>). You may use
any Sui explorer to look at its content, as well as explore the content of blob objects.
There is more information about these in the
<a href="dev-guide/sui-struct.html">quick reference to the Walrus Sui structures</a>.</p>
<p>Walrus is also composed of a number of Walrus-specific services and binaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>A client (binary) can be executed locally and provides a
<a href="dev-guide/../usage/client-cli.html">Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>, a <a href="dev-guide/../usage/json-api.html">JSON API</a>
and an <a href="dev-guide/../usage/web-api.html">HTTP API</a> to perform Walrus operations.</li>
<li>Aggregators services allow reading blobs via HTTP requests.</li>
<li>Publishers services are used store blobs to Walrus.</li>
<li>A set of storage nodes store encoded blobs. These nodes form the decentralized
storage infrastructure of Walrus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aggregators, publishers and other services use the client APIs to interact with Walrus. End-users
of services using Walrus interact with the store via custom services, aggregators or publishers that
expose HTTP APIs to avoid the need to run locally a binary client.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="operations-1"><a class="header" href="#operations-1">Operations</a></h1>
<h2 id="blob-encoding-and-blob-id"><a class="header" href="#blob-encoding-and-blob-id">Blob encoding and blob ID</a></h2>
<p>Walrus stores blobs across storage nodes in an <a href="dev-guide/../overview/encoding.html">encoded form</a>, and refers
to blobs by their <em>blob ID</em>. The blob ID is deterministically derived from the content of a blob
and the Walrus configuration. The blob ID of two files with the same content will be the same.</p>
<p>You can derive the blob ID of a file locally using the command: <code>walrus blob-id &lt;file path&gt;</code></p>
<h2 id="store"><a class="header" href="#store">Store</a></h2>
<p>Walrus may be used to <strong>store a blob</strong>, via the native client APIs or a publisher.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>All blobs
stored in Walrus are public and discoverable by all</strong>. Therefore you must not use Walrus to store
anything that contains secrets or private data without additional measures to protect
confidentiality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the hood a number of operations happen both on Sui as well as on storage nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The client or publisher encodes the blob and derives a <em>blob ID</em> that identifies the blob. This
is a <code>u256</code> often encoded as a URL safe base64 string.</li>
<li>A transaction is executed on Sui to purchase some storage from the system object, and then to
<em>register the blob ID</em> occupying this storage. Client APIs return the <em>Sui blob object ID</em>. The
transactions use SUI to purchase storage and pay for gas.</li>
<li>Encoded slivers of the blob are distributed to all storage nodes. They each sign a receipt.</li>
<li>Signed receipts are aggregated and submitted to the Sui blob object to <em>certify the blob</em>.
Certifying a blob emits a Sui event with the blob ID and the period of availability.</li>
</ul>
<p>A blob is considered available on Walrus once the corresponding Sui blob object has been
certified in the final step. The steps involved in a store operation can be executed by the binary
client, or a publisher that accepts and publishes blobs via HTTP.</p>
<p>Walrus currently allows the storage of blobs up to a maximum size that may be determined
through the <a href="dev-guide/../usage/client-cli.html#walrus-system-information"><code>walrus info</code></a> CLI command. The
maximum blob size is currently 957 MiB. You may store larger blobs by splitting them into
smaller chunks.</p>
<p>Blobs are stored for a certain number of <em>epochs</em>, as specified at the time they were stored. Walrus
storage nodes ensure that within these epochs a read succeeds. The Walrus devnet only uses a single
epoch today, and blobs uploaded will be available in that single epoch (until the devnet is wiped).
Future devnets may span across multiple epochs.</p>
<h2 id="read"><a class="header" href="#read">Read</a></h2>
<p>Walrus can also be used to <strong>read a blob</strong> after it is stored by providing its blob ID.
A read is executed by performing the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>The system object on Sui is read to determine the Walrus storage node committee.</li>
<li>A number of storage nodes are queried for blob metadata and the slivers they store.</li>
<li>The blob is reconstructed from the recovered slivers and checked against the blob ID.</li>
</ul>
<p>The steps involved in the read operation are performed by the binary client, or the aggregator
service that exposes an HTTP interface to read blobs. Reads are extremely resilient and will
succeed in recovering the blob stored even if up to one-third of storage nodes are
unavailable in all cases. Eventually, after synchronization is complete, even if two-thirds
of storage nodes are down reads will succeed.</p>
<h2 id="certify-availability"><a class="header" href="#certify-availability">Certify Availability</a></h2>
<p>Walrus can be used to <strong>certify the availability of a blob</strong> using Sui. Checking that this happened
may currently be done in 3 different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Sui SDK read can be
used to authenticate the certified blob event emitted when the blob ID was certified on Sui. The
client <code>walrus blob-status</code> command may be used to identify the event ID that needs to be checked.</li>
<li>A Sui SDK read may be
used to authenticate the Sui blob object corresponding to the blob ID, and check it is certified.</li>
<li>A Sui smart contract can read the blob object on Sui (or a reference to it) to check
is is certified.</li>
</ul>
<p>The underlying protocol of the
<a href="https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-light-client">Sui light client</a>
returns digitally signed evidence for emitted events
or objects, and can be used by off-line or non-interactive applications as a proof of availability
for the blob ID for a certain number of epochs.</p>
<p>Once a blob is certified, Walrus will ensure that sufficient slivers will always be

<p>This section is optional and enables advanced use cases.</p>
<p>You can interact with Walrus purely
through the client CLI, and JSON or HTTP APIs provided, without querying or executing transactions
on Sui directly. However, Walrus uses Sui to manage its metadata and smart contract developers can
read information about the Walrus system, as well as stored blobs, on Sui.</p>
<p>This section provides an overview of how you may use Walrus objects in your Sui smart contracts.</p>
<h2 id="blob-and-storage-objects"><a class="header" href="#blob-and-storage-objects">Blob and Storage Objects</a></h2>
<p>Walrus blobs are represented as Sui objects of type <code>Blob</code>. A blob is first registered, indicating
that the storage nodes should expect slivers from a Blob ID to be stored. Then a blob is certified
indicating that a sufficient number of slivers have been stored to guarantee the blob's
availability. When a blob is certified its <code>certified</code> field contains the epoch in which it was
certified.</p>
<p>A <code>Storage</code> object is always associated with a <code>Blob</code> object, reserving enough space for
a long enough period for the blob's storage. A certified blob is available for the period the
underlying storage resource guarantees storage.</p>
<p>Concretely, <code>Blob</code> and <code>Storage</code> objects have the following fields, that can be read through the
Sui SDKs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-move">/// The blob structure represents a blob that has been registered to with some
/// storage, and then may eventually be certified as being available in the
/// system.
public struct Blob has key, store {
    id: UID,
    stored_epoch: u64,
    blob_id: u256,
    size: u64,
    erasure_code_type: u8,
    certified: option::Option&lt;u64&gt;, // The epoch first certified,
                                    // or None if not certified.
    storage: Storage,
}

/// Reservation for storage for a given period, which is inclusive start,
/// exclusive end.
public struct Storage has key, store {
    id: UID,
    start_epoch: u64,
    end_epoch: u64,
    storage_size: u64,
}
</code></pre>
<p>All fields of <code>Blob</code> and <code>Storage</code> objects can be read using the expected functions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-move">// Blob functions
public fun stored_epoch(b: &amp;Blob) : u64;
public fun blob_id(b: &amp;Blob) : u256;
public fun size(b: &amp;Blob) : u64;

// Storage functions
public fun start_epoch(self: &amp;Storage) : u64;
public fun end_epoch(self: &amp;Storage) : u64;
public fun storage_size(self: &amp;Storage) : u64;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="events"><a class="header" href="#events">Events</a></h2>
<p>When a blob is first registered a <code>BlobRegistered</code> event is emitted that informs storage nodes
that they should expect slivers associated with its Blob ID. Eventually when the blob is
certified a <code>BlobCertified</code> is emitted containing information about the blob ID and the epoch
after which the blob will be deleted. Before that epoch the blob is guaranteed to be available.</p>
<pre><code class="language-move">/// Signals a blob with metadata is registered.
public struct BlobRegistered has copy, drop {
    epoch: u64,
    blob_id: u256,
    size: u64,
    erasure_code_type: u8,
    end_epoch: u64,
}

/// Signals a blob is certified.
public struct BlobCertified has copy, drop {
    epoch: u64,
    blob_id: u256,
    end_epoch: u64,
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>InvalidBlobID</code> event is emitted when storage nodes detect an incorrectly encoded blob.
Anyone attempting a read on such a blob is guaranteed to also detect it as invalid.</p>
<pre><code class="language-move">/// Signals that a BlobID is invalid.
public struct InvalidBlobID has copy, drop {
    epoch: u64, // The epoch in which the blob ID is first registered as invalid
    blob_id: u256,
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="system-information"><a class="header" href="#system-information">System information</a></h2>
<p>The Walrus system object contains metadata about the available and used storage, as well as the
price of storage per Kib of storage in MIST. The committee
structure within the system object can be used to read the current epoch number, as well as
information about the committee.</p>
<pre><code class="language-move">const BYTES_PER_UNIT_SIZE : u64 = 1_024;

public struct System&lt;phantom WAL&gt; has key, store {

public struct Committee has store {

<p>A few public functions of the committee allow contracts to read Walrus metadata:</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="setup"><a class="header" href="#setup">Setup</a></h1>
<p>At this stage of the project, our Walrus code is not yet public. Instead, we provide a pre-compiled
<code>walrus</code> client binary for macOS (Intel and Apple CPUs) and Ubuntu, which supports different usage
patterns (see <a href="usage/./interacting.html">the next chapter</a>). This chapter describes the
<a href="usage/./prerequisites.html">prerequisites</a>, <a href="usage/./installation.html">installation</a>, and
<a href="usage/./configuration.html">configuration</a> of the Walrus client.</p>
<p>Note that our Walrus devnet uses Sui <strong>testnet</strong> for coordination.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="prerequisites"><a class="header" href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h1>
<p>Interacting with Walrus requires a valid Sui <strong>testnet</strong> wallet with some amount of SUI tokens. The
easiest way to set this up is via the Sui CLI; see the <a href="https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install">installation
instructions</a> in the Sui
documentation.</p>
<p>After installing the Sui CLI, you need to set up a testnet wallet by running <code>sui client</code>, which
prompts you to set up a new configuration. You can use the full node at
<code>https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443</code>. See
<a href="https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/connect">here</a> for further details.</p>
<p>Finally, you need to get at least two SUI testnet coins from the faucet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">sui client faucet &amp;&amp; sui client faucet
</code></pre>
<p>The system-wide wallet will be used by Walrus if no other path is specified. If you want to use a
different Sui wallet, you can specify this in the <a href="usage/./configuration.html">Walrus configuration file</a> or
when <a href="usage/./interacting.html">running the CLI</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="installation"><a class="header" href="#installation">Installation</a></h1>
<p>We currently provide the <code>walrus</code> client binary for macOS (Intel and Apple CPUs) and Ubuntu. You can
download the latest build from our Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">SYSTEM=macos-arm64 # or macos-x86_64 or ubuntu-x86_64
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/mysten-walrus-binaries/latest/walrus-latest-$SYSTEM -o walrus
chmod +x walrus
</code></pre>
<p>You can then run the CLI simply as <code>./walrus</code>, or, if it is in a different location, as
<code>path/to/walrus</code>.  Alternatively, you can also place it into any directory that is in your <code>$PATH</code>
and run it as <code>walrus</code>. See <a href="usage/./interacting.html">the next chapter</a> for further details on how to use
it.</p>
<p>In addition to the latest version of the <code>walrus</code> binary, the GCS bucket also contains previous
versions. An overview in XML format is available at
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/mysten-walrus-binaries/">https://storage.googleapis.com/mysten-walrus-binaries/</a>.</p>

<p>You can configure the Walrus client through a <code>client_config.yaml</code> file. By default, the CLI will
look for it in the current directory or in <code>~/.walrus/</code>, but you can specify a custom path through
the <code>--client</code> option.</p>
<p>The configuration file currently supports the following parameters:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># This is the only mandatory field. The system object is specific for a particular Walrus

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="json-mode"><a class="header" href="#json-mode">JSON mode</a></h1>
<p>All Walrus client commands (except, currently, the <code>info</code> command) are also available in JSON mode.
In this mode, all the command line flags of the original CLI command can be specified in JSON
format. The JSON mode therefore simplifies programmatic access to the CLI.</p>
<p>For example, to store a blob, run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">walrus json \
    '{
        "config": "path/to/client_config.yaml",
        "command": {
            "store": {
                "file": "README.md"
            }
        }
    }'
</code></pre>
<p>Or, to read a blob knowing the blob ID:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">walrus json \
    '{
        "config": "path/to/client_config.yaml",
        "command": {
            "read": {
                "blobId": "4BKcDC0Ih5RJ8R0tFMz3MZVNZV8b2goT6_JiEEwNHQo"
            }
        }
    }'
</code></pre>
<p>All options, default values, and commands are equal to those of the "standard" CLI mode, except that
they are written in "camelCase" instead of "kebab-case".</p>
<p>The <code>json</code> command also accepts input from <code>stdin</code>.</p>
<p>The output of a <code>json</code> command will itself be JSON-formatted, again to simplify parsing the results
in a programmatic way. For example, the JSON output can be piped to the <code>jq</code> command for parsing and
manually extracting relevant fields.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="client-daemon-mode--http-api"><a class="header" href="#client-daemon-mode--http-api">Client Daemon mode &amp; HTTP API</a></h1>
<p>In addition to the CLI and JSON modes, the Walrus client offers a <em>daemon mode</em>. In this mode, it
runs a simple web server offering HTTP interfaces to store and read blobs in an aggregator and
publisher role respectively. We also offer
<a href="usage/web-api.html#public-services">public aggregator and publisher services</a> to try the Walrus HTTP APIs without
the need to run a local client.</p>
<h2 id="starting-the-daemon-locally"><a class="header" href="#starting-the-daemon-locally">Starting the daemon locally</a></h2>
<p>You can run the daemon with the following command, to offer both an aggregator and publisher on
the same address and port:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">ADDRESS="127.0.0.1:31415" # bind the daemon to localhost and port 31415 for both
walrus daemon -b $ADDRESS # run a daemon combining an aggregator and a publisher
</code></pre>
<p>Or you may run two separate processes. One for the aggregator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">AGG_ADDRESS="127.0.0.1:31415" # Aggregator only port
walrus aggregator -b $AGG_ADDRESS # run an aggregator to read blobs
</code></pre>
<p>And a different one for the publisher:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">PUB_ADDRESS="127.0.0.1:31416" # Note different port for publisher
walrus publisher -b $PUB_ADDRESS # run a publisher to store blobs
</code></pre>
<p>The aggregator provides all read APIs, the publisher all the store APIs, and the daemon provides
both. Note that the aggregator does not perform Sui on-chain actions, and therefore consumes no gas.
However, the publisher does perform actions on-chain and will consume gas. It is therefore important
to ensure only authorized parties may access it, or other measures to manage gas costs.</p>
<h2 id="public-services"><a class="header" href="#public-services">Using a public aggregator or publisher</a></h2>
<p>For some use cases (e.g., a public website), or to just try out the HTTP API, a publicly accessible
aggregator and/or publisher is required. For your convenience, we provide these at the following
hosts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregator: <code>http://sea-dnt-sto-00.devnet.sui.io:9000</code></li>
<li>Publisher: <code>http://ord-dnt-sto-00.devnet.sui.io:9000</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the publisher consumes (testnet) Sui on the service side, and a mainnet deployment would
likely not be able to provide uncontrolled public access to publishing without requiring some
authentication and compensation for the Sui used.</p>
<h2 id="http-api-usage"><a class="header" href="#http-api-usage">HTTP API Usage</a></h2>
<h3 id="store-1"><a class="header" href="#store-1">Store</a></h3>
<p>You can interact with the daemon through simple HTTP PUT requests. For example, with
<a href="https://curl.se">cURL</a>, you can store blobs using a publisher or daemon as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">ADDRESS="127.0.0.1:31415"
curl -X PUT "http://$ADDRESS/v1/store" -d "some string" # store the string `some string` for 1 storage epoch
curl -X PUT "http://$ADDRESS/v1/store?epochs=5" --upload-file "some/file" # store file `some/file` for 5 storage epochs
</code></pre>
<p>The store HTTP API end points return information about the blob stored in JSON format. When a blob
is stored for the first time, a <code>newlyCreated</code> field contains information about the
new blob:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ curl -X PUT "http://ord-dnt-sto-00.devnet.sui.io:9000/v1/store" -d "some other string"
{
  "newlyCreated":{
    "id":"0xa74d376bb6923c4b8d73825fce3b798524e2bda34d02dae64ab5865556c54000",
    "storedEpoch":0,
    "blobId":"gsYzDXsK326Wihzt3X5evZCPFgaNZrb84zCjodLJaVs",
    "size":36,
    "erasureCodeType":"RedStuff",
    "certified":0,
    "storage":{
        "id":"0x2479b3096efa58fa9bfbebe805268746c235110ee0713e5a123d8f1754c2ccc3",
        "startEpoch":0,
        "endEpoch":1,
        "storageSize":4747680
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The information returned is the content of the <a href="usage/../dev-guide/sui-struct.html">Sui blob object</a>.</p>
<p>When the aggregator finds a certified blob with the same blob ID and a sufficient validity period,
it returns a <code>alreadyCertified</code> JSON structure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ curl -X PUT "http://ord-dnt-sto-00.devnet.sui.io:9000/v1/store" -d "some other string"
{
  "alreadyCertified":{
    "blobId":"gsYzDXsK326Wihzt3X5evZCPFgaNZrb84zCjodLJaVs",
    "event":{
      "txDigest":"2oMC1dTaMGpApphFWKzARSsTM9837ox4zN8rY2RqLf6c",
      "eventSeq":"0"
    },
    "endEpoch":1
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The field <code>event</code> returns the <a href="usage/../dev-guide/sui-struct.html">Sui event ID</a> that can be used to
find the transaction that created the Sui Blob object on the Sui explorer or using a Sui SDK.</p>
<h3 id="read-1"><a class="header" href="#read-1">Read</a></h3>
<p>Blobs may be read from an aggregator or daemon using HTTP GET. For example the following cURL
command reads a blob and writes it to an output file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">ADDRESS="127.0.0.1:31415"
curl "http://$ADDRESS/v1/&lt;some blob ID&gt; -o &lt;some file name&gt;"
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively you may print the contents of a blob in the terminal with the cURL command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">ADDRESS="127.0.0.1:31415"
curl "http://$ADDRESS/v1/&lt;some blob ID&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Modern browsers will attempt to sniff the content type for such resources, and will generally do a
good job of inferring content types for media. However, the aggregator on purpose prevents such
sniffing from inferring dangerous executable types such as javascript or style sheet types.</p>

can build and deploy a Walrus Site and make it accessible to the World!</p>
<p>At a high level, the most exciting features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing a site does not require managing servers or complex configurations; just provide the
source files (produced by your favorite web framework), publish them to Walrus Sites using the
<a href="walrus-sites/./site-builder.html">site builder tool</a>, and you are done!</li>
<li>Sites can be linked to from ordinary Sui objects. This feature enables, for example, creating an
NFT collection in which <em>every single NFT</em> has a <em>personalized website dedicated to it</em>.</li>
<li>Walrus Sites are owned by addresses on Sui and can be exchanged, shared, and updated thanks to
Sui's flexible programming model. This means, among other things, that Walrus Sites can leverage
the <a href="https://suins.io/">SuiNS</a> naming system to have human readable names. No more messing around
with DNS!</li>
<li>Thanks to Walrus' decentralization and extremely high data availability, there is no risk of
having your site wiped for no reason.</li>
<li>Since they live on Walrus, these sites cannot have a backend in the traditional sense, and can be
therefore considered "static" sites. However, the developer can harness Sui's programmability
to add backend functionality to Walrus Sites!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="show-me"><a class="header" href="#show-me">Show me</a></h2>
<p>To give you a very high level intuition of how Walrus Sites work, let's look at an example: A simple
NFT collection on Sui that has a frontend dApp to mint the NFTs hosted on Walrus Sites, and in
which <em>each NFT</em> has a <em>specific, personalized Walrus Site</em>.</p>
<p>You can check out the mint page at <a href="https://flatland.walrus.site/">https://flatland.walrus.site/</a>. This site is serve to your
browser through the Walrus Site <em>Portal</em> <a href="https://walrus.site">https://walrus.site</a>. While the Portal's operation is
explained in a <a href="walrus-sites/./portal.html">later section</a>, consider for now that there can be many Portals (hosted
by whoever wants to have their own, and even on <code>localhost</code>). Further, the only function of the
Portal is to provide the browser with some code (specifically, a service worker) that allows it to
fetch the Walrus Site from Sui and Walrus.</p>
<p>If you have a Sui wallet with some Testnet SUI, you can try and "mint a new Flatlander" from the
site. This creates an NFT from the collection, and shows you two links, one to the explorer, and one
to the "Flatlander site". This latter site is a special Walrus Site that exists only for that NFT,
and has special characteristics (the background color, the image...) that are based on the contents
of the NFT.</p>
<p>The URL to this per-NFT site look something like this
<code>https://4egmmrw9izzjn0dm2lkd3k0l8phk386z60ub1tpdc1jswbb5dr.walrus.site/</code>.  You'll notice that the
domain remains <code>walrus.site</code>, but the subdomain is a long and random-looking string.  This string is
actually the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base36">Base36</a> encoding of the object ID of the NFT,
which is
<a href="https://suiscan.xyz/testnet/object/0xb09b312b28049467dd6173b6cebb60ed5fe3046883e248632bf9fb20b7dbdaff">0xb09b312b...</a>.</p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walrus Sites are served through a Portal; in this case, <code>https://walrus.site</code>. There can be many
Portals, and anyone can host one.</li>
<li>The subdomain on the URL points to a specific object on Sui, that allows the browser to fetch and
render the site resources. This pointer can be:
<ul>
<li>A SuiNS name, such as <code>flatland</code> in <code>https://flatland.walrus.site</code>; or</li>
<li>the Base36 encoding of a the Sui object ID, such as <code>0xb09b312b...</code> in the example above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="installing-the-site-builder"><a class="header" href="#installing-the-site-builder">Installing the site builder</a></h1>
<p>We describe here the steps necessary to setup the Walrus Sites' <code>site-builder</code> tool, and prepare
your environment for development.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites-1"><a class="header" href="#prerequisites-1">Prerequisites</a></h2>
<p>Before you start, make sure you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a recent version of <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">Rust</a> installed; and</li>
<li>have the <a href="https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install">Sui CLI</a> installed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, follow these additional setup steps.</p>
<h2 id="get-the-walrus-binary-and-install-it"><a class="header" href="#get-the-walrus-binary-and-install-it">Get the <code>walrus</code> binary and install it</a></h2>
<p>Download the latest <code>walrus</code> binary for your architecture from
<code>https://storage.googleapis.com/mysten-walrus-binaries/walrus-v0.1.0-a0fb8c9-&lt;arch&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;arch&gt;</code>
is your architecture. The available options are listed in this table:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>OS</th><th>CPU</th><th>Architecture</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>MacOS</td><td>Apple Silicon</td><td><code>macos-arm64</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>MacOS</td><td>Intel 64bit</td><td><code>macos-x86_64</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Ubuntu</td><td>Intel 64bit</td><td><code>ubuntu-x86_64</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Then, add it to your <code>$PATH</code>. For example, on MacOS you can copy it to
<code>/Users/myusername/.local/bin/</code> (check what directories are in your <code>$PATH</code> by running <code>echo $PATH</code>).</p>
<p>Once this is done, you should be able to type <code>walrus</code> in your terminal and see:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">Walrus client

Usage: walrus [OPTIONS] &lt;COMMAND&gt;

⋮
</code></pre>
<p>If, for any reason, you don't want to add <code>walrus</code> to <code>$PATH</code>, place the binary in your preferred
directory, and remember to configure a pointer to the binary in the <code>site-builder</code> config (more on
this <a href="walrus-sites/./tutorial-config.html">later</a>).</p>

<p>Walrus is currently deployed on Sui Testnet. Therefore, you have to ensure that your Sui CLI is
configured accordingly:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>If the <code>active</code> network is not <code>testnet</code>, switch to <code>testnet</code> by running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">sui client switch --envs testnet
</code></pre>
<p>Further, make sure you have at least 2 separate gas coins, with at least 1 SUI each, by running <code>sui client gas</code>.  If you don't have enough SUI, you can hit the testnet faucet by running.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">sui client faucet --url https://faucet.testnet.sui.io/v1/gas
</code></pre>
<p>After some seconds, running again <code>sui client gas</code> should show the newly-minted coins in your
wallet.</p>

<h2 id="select-the-source-material-for-the-site"><a class="header" href="#select-the-source-material-for-the-site">Select the source material for the site</a></h2>
<p>The <code>site-builder</code> works by uploading a directory of files produced by any web framework to Walrus,
and adding the relevant metadata to Sui. This directory should have a file called <code>index.html</code> in
its root, which will be the entry point to the Walrus Site.</p>
<p>For the rest of the tutorial, we will use as an example the simple site contained in
<code>./examples/snake</code>.</p>
<h2 id="publish-the-site"><a class="header" href="#publish-the-site">Publish the site</a></h2>
<p>Since we have placed the <code>walrus</code> binary and configuration in their default locations, publishing
the <code>./examples/snake</code> site is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ensure that you are in the <code>site-builder</code> directory;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the publishing command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./target/release/site-builder --config assets/builder-example.yaml publish ../examples/snake

</li>
</ul>
<p>The output should look like the following:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>This output tells you that, for each file in the folder, a new Walrus blob was created, and the
respective blob ID.  Further it prints the object ID of the Walrus Site object on Sui (so you can
have a look in the explorer, and use it to set the SuiNS name), and, finally, the URL at which you
can browse the site.</p>
<p>Note here that we are passing the example config <code>assets/builder-example.yaml</code> as the config for the
site builder. The configuration file is necessary to ensure that the <code>site-builder</code> knows the
correct Sui package for the Walrus Sites logic.</p>
<p>More details on the configuration of the <code>site-builder</code> can be found under the <a href="walrus-sites/tutorial-config.html">advanced
configuration</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="update-the-site"><a class="header" href="#update-the-site">Update the site</a></h2>
<p>Let's say now you want to update the content of the site, for example by changing the title from
"eat all the blobs!" to "Glob all the Blobs!".</p>
<p>First, make this edit on in the <code>../examples/snake/index.html</code> file.</p>
<p>Then, you can update the existing site by running the <code>update</code> command, and providing the directory
where to find the updated files (still <code>../example/snake</code>), and the object ID of the existing site
(<code>0x5ac988...</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./target/release/site-builder --config assets/builder-example.yaml update ../examples/snake 0x5ac9888...

<p>The output this time should be:</p>

<p>Compared to the <code>publish</code> action, we can see that now the only actions performed were to delete the
old <code>index.html</code>, and update it with the newer one.</p>
<p>Browsing to the provided URL should reflect the change. You've updated the site!</p>
<h2 id="additional-commands"><a class="header" href="#additional-commands">Additional commands</a></h2>
<p>The <code>site-builder</code> tool provides two additional utilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>convert</code> command, which converts an object ID in hex format to the equivalent Base36
format. This command is useful if you have the Sui object ID of a Walrus Site, and want to know
the subdomain where you can browse it.</li>
<li>the <code>sitemap</code> command, which shows the resources that compose the Walrus Site at the given object
ID.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, the <code>--help</code> flag is your friend!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="bonus-set-a-suins-name"><a class="header" href="#bonus-set-a-suins-name">Bonus: Set a SuiNS name</a></h1>
<p>Browsing a URL like <code>https://29gjzk8yjl1v7zm2etee1siyzaqfj9jaru5ufs6yyh1yqsgun2.walrus.site</code> is not
particularly nice. Therefore, Walrus Sites allows to use SuiNS names (this is like DNS for Sui) to
give human-readable names to site. To do so, you simply have to get a SuiNS name you like, and point
it to the object ID of the Walrus Site (as provided by the <code>publish</code> or <code>update</code> commands).</p>
<p>Let's do this step by step.</p>
<h2 id="get-a-suins-name"><a class="header" href="#get-a-suins-name">Get a SuiNS name</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to <a href="https://testnet.suins.io/">https://testnet.suins.io/</a>, and buy a domain name with
your testnet wallet. For example, <code>walrusgame</code> (NOTE: this is already taken, choose another you
like!). NOTE: At the moment, you can only select names that are composed of letters <code>a-z</code> and
numbers <code>0-9</code>, but no special characters (e.g., <code>-</code>).</li>
<li>In the <a href="https://testnet.suins.io/account/my-names">page</a> listing the domains you own, you should
see the newly-bought name.</li>
<li>Click the three-dots menu on the top-right corner of the name you want to assign. Choose "View all
info", and copy the <code>ObjectID</code>. In our case, this is
<code>0x6412c4cfbe50e219c2d4d30108d7321d064e15bf64e752307100bff5eb91da38</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="send-the-suins-registration-object-to-the-address-you-use-with-the-sui-cli"><a class="header" href="#send-the-suins-registration-object-to-the-address-you-use-with-the-sui-cli">Send the SuiNS registration object to the address you use with the Sui CLI</a></h2>
<p>The steps that follow require that the SuiNS registration object is owned by the address you are
using on the Sui CLI. Therefore, we need to send this registration object from the address you use
in your browser wallet, to the address of your Sui CLI.</p>
<p>To find the Sui CLI address, execute:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">sui client active-address
</code></pre>
<p>Then, from your browser wallet, select the "Assets" tab, and look for the NFT of the SuiNS
registration, which should look as follows:</p>
<p><img src="walrus-sites/../assets/suins-asset.png" alt="the SuiNS registration inside the wallet" /></p>
<p>Click on it, scroll down to "Send NFT", and send it to the address discovered with the command
above. Now, your Sui CLI address owns the registration NFT, and you can proceed to the next step.</p>
<h2 id="map-the-suins-name-to-the-walrus-site"><a class="header" href="#map-the-suins-name-to-the-walrus-site">Map the SuiNS name to the Walrus Site</a></h2>
<p>This step associates the name <code>walrusgame</code> to the object ID of our Walrus Site. There are possibly
many ways to achieve this, and as the SuiNS UI improves this could be done from the webapp as well.</p>
<p>Here, we issue an transaction using the Sui CLI that creates this mapping:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">SUINS_CORE_PACKAGE=0x22fa05f21b1ad71442491220bb9338f7b7095fe35000ef88d5400d28523bdd93

MY_SUINS_REGISTRATION_OBJECT=0x6412... # adjust this to your own SuiNS object
MY_WALRUS_SITE_OBJECT=0x5ac9... # adjust this to your Walrus Site object
sui client call \
    --package $SUINS_CORE_PACKAGE \
    --module controller \
    --function set_target_address \
    --gas-budget 500000000 \

    --args "[$MY_WALRUS_SITE_OBJECT]" \
    --args 0x6
</code></pre>
<p>Note that SuiNS package and object on testnet may change, you can find the latest ones in the <a href="https://docs.suins.io/#active-constants">SuiNS
documentation</a> (make sure you select <em>Testnet</em>).</p>
<p>If all succeeds, we can now browse <a href="https://walrusgame.walrus.site">https://walrusgame.walrus.site</a>!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="configuring-the-site-builder"><a class="header" href="#configuring-the-site-builder">Configuring the site builder</a></h1>
<p>Configuring the <code>site-builder</code> tool is straightforward, but care is required to ensure that
everything works correctly.</p>
<p>The <code>site-builder</code> tool requires a configuration file to know which package to use on Sui, which
wallet to use, the gas budget, and other operational details. Most of these are abstracted away
through sensible defaults, so you should not need to touch them. Yet, for completeness, we provide
here the details for all the configuration options.</p>
<h2 id="minimal-configuration"><a class="header" href="#minimal-configuration">Minimal configuration</a></h2>
<p>The config file is expected to be in <code>./builder.yaml</code>, and it is possible to point elsewhere with
the <code>--config</code> flag.  For your first run, it should be sufficient to call the <code>site-builder</code> with
<code>--config assets/builder-example.yaml</code>, which is already configured appropriately.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-configuration"><a class="header" href="#advanced-configuration">Advanced configuration</a></h2>
<p>If you want to have more control over the behavior of the site builder, you can customize the
following variables in the config file:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>package</code>: the object ID of the Walrus Sites package on Sui. This must always be specified in the
config, and is already appropriately configured in <code>assets/example-config.yaml</code>.</li>
<li><code>portal</code>: the name of the Portal through which the site will be viewed; this only affects the
output of the CLI, and nothing else (default: <code>walrus.site</code>).
All Walrus Sites are accessible through any Portal independent of this setting.</li>
<li><code>general</code>: these are general options, that can be configured both through the CLI and the config:
<ul>
<li><code>rpc_url</code>: The URL of the Sui RPC node to use. If not set, the <code>site-builder</code> will infer it from
the wallet.</li>
<li><code>wallet</code>: Pointer to the Sui wallet to be used. By default, it uses the system-wide wallet (the
one from <code>sui client addresses</code>).</li>
<li><code>walrus_binary</code>: Pointer to the <code>walrus</code> binary. By default, this is expected to be run from
<code>$PATH</code>.</li>
<li><code>walrus_config</code>: The configuration for the <code>walrus</code> client binary. See the relative
documentation (TODO: link).</li>
<li><code>gas_budget</code>: The maximum amount of gas to be spent for transactions (default: 500M MIST).</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Walrus Sites can be used to deploy almost any form of traditional static "Web 2" website build for
modern browsers. There are, however, a number of restrictions that a developer should keep in mind
when creating or porting a website to Walrus Sites.</p>
<h2 id="no-secret-values"><a class="header" href="#no-secret-values">No secret values</a></h2>
<p>Walrus Sites are fully publicly accessible, as the metadata is stored on Sui and the site content is
stored on Walrus. Therefore, developers <em>must</em> not store secret values within the sites.</p>
<p>We emphasize again that any such backend-specific operations (storing secret values, authentication,
etc.) are achievable by leveraging the integration with Sui blockchain and the Sui wallet.</p>
<h2 id="there-is-a-maximum-redirect-depth"><a class="header" href="#there-is-a-maximum-redirect-depth">There is a maximum redirect depth</a></h2>
<p>The number of consecutive redirects a Walrus Site can perform is capped by the
Portal (see <a href="walrus-sites/./portal.html">Portal configuration</a>).  This measure ensures that loading a Walrus Site
does not result in an infinite loading loop.</p>
<p>Different Portals can set this limit as they desire. The limit for the Portal hosted at
<a href="http://walrus.site">walrus.site</a> has a maximum redirect depth of 3.</p>
<h2 id="service-workers-are-not-available"><a class="header" href="#service-workers-are-not-available">Service workers are not available</a></h2>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: This limitation only applies to Portal based on service workers. A web Portal will not
have this limitation.</p>
<p>Walrus Sites leverage service workers in the clients' browsers to perform these essential
operations:</p>
<ol>
<li>reading the site metadata from Sui;</li>
<li>fetching the page content from Walrus; and</li>
<li>serving the content to the browser.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, a site deployed on Walrus Sites cannot use service workers. Installing a service worker
from within a Walrus Site will result in a dysfunctional site and a poor experience for the user.</p>
<h2 id="the-ios-sui-wallet-mobile-does-not-work-with-walrus-sites"><a class="header" href="#the-ios-sui-wallet-mobile-does-not-work-with-walrus-sites">The iOS Sui Wallet Mobile does not work with Walrus Sites</a></h2>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: This limitation only applies to Portal based on service workers. A web Portal will not
have this limitation.</p>
<p>Service workers cannot be loaded inside an in-app browser on iOS, because of a limitation of the
WebKit engine. As a consequence, Walrus Sites cannot be used within the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sui-wallet-mobile/id6476572140">Sui Wallet
Mobile</a> app on iOS, and therefore
the Sui wallet can currently not be used on a Walrus Site on iOS. Note, however, that <em>browsing</em> a
Walrus Site is still possible on iOS through any browser. Only the connection to the wallet is
impacted.</p>
<p>The connection with the Sui Wallet Mobile app works on Android devices.</p>

<p>To make communication as clear and efficient as possible, we make sure to use a single term for
every Walrus entity/concept and <em>do not</em> use any synonyms. The following table lists various
concepts, their canonical name, how they relate to / differ from other terms.</p>
<p>Italicized terms in the description indicate other specific Walrus terms contained in the table.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Approved name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>storage node (SN)</td><td>entity storing data for Walrus; holds one or several <em>shards</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>blob</td><td>single unstructured data object stored on Walrus</td></tr>
<tr><td>shard</td><td>(disjoint) subset of erasure-encoded data of all <em>blobs</em>; at every point in time, a <em>shard</em> is assigned to and stored on a single <em>SN</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>sliver</td><td>erasure-encoded data of one <em>shard</em> corresponding to a single blob for one of the two encodings; this contains several erasure-encoded symbols of that blob but not the <em>blob metadata</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>blob ID</td><td>cryptographic ID computed from a <em>blob</em>’s <em>slivers</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>blob metadata</td><td>metadata of one <em>blob</em>; in particular, this contains a hash per <em>shard</em> to enable the authentication of <em>slivers</em> and recovery symbols</td></tr>
<tr><td>(end) user</td><td>any entity/person that wants to store or read <em>blobs</em> on/from Walrus; can act as a Walrus client itself or use the simple interface exposed by <em>publishers</em> and <em>caches</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>publisher</td><td>service interacting with Sui and the <em>SNs</em> to store <em>blobs</em> on Walrus; offers a simple HTTP POST endpoint to <em>end users</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>aggregator</td><td>service that reconstructs <em>blobs</em> by interacting with <em>SNs</em> and exposes a simple HTTP GET endpoint to <em>end users</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>cache</td><td>an <em>aggregator</em> with additional caching capabilities</td></tr>
<tr><td>(Walrus) client</td><td>entity interacting directly with the <em>SNs</em>; this can be an <em>aggregator</em>/<em>cache</em>, a <em>publisher</em>, or an <em>end user</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>(blob) reconstruction</td><td>decoding of the primary <em>slivers</em> to obtain the blob; includes re-encoding the <em>blob</em> and checking the Merkle proofs</td></tr>
<tr><td>(shard/sliver) recovery</td><td>process of an SN recovering a <em>sliver</em> or full <em>shard</em> by obtaining recovery symbols from other <em>SNs</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>storage attestation</td><td>process where <em>SNs</em> exchange challenges and responses to demonstrate that they are storing their currently assigned <em>shards</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>certificate of availability (CoA)</td><td>a <em>blob ID</em> with signatures of <em>SNs</em> holding at least $2f+1$ <em>shards</em> in a specific <em>epoch</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>point of availability (PoA)</td><td>point in time when a <em>CoA</em> is submitted to Sui and the corresponding <em>blob</em> is guaranteed to be available until its expiration</td></tr>
<tr><td>inconsistency proof</td><td>set of several recovery symbols with their Merkle proofs such that the decoded <em>sliver</em> does not match the corresponding hash; this proves an incorrect/inconsistent encoding by the client</td></tr>
<tr><td>inconsistency certificate</td><td>an aggregated signature from 2/3 of <em>SNs</em> (weighted by their number of <em>shards</em>) that they have seen and stored an <em>inconsistency proof</em> for a <em>blob ID</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>storage committee</td><td>the set of <em>SNs</em> for a <em>storage epoch</em>, including metadata about the <em>shards</em> they are responsible for and other metadata</td></tr>
<tr><td>member</td><td>an <em>SN</em> that is part of a <em>committee</em> at some <em>epoch</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>storage epoch</td><td>the epoch for Walrus as distinct to the epoch for Sui</td></tr>
<tr><td>availability period</td><td>the period specified in <em>storage epochs</em> for which a <em>blob</em> is certified to be available on Walrus</td></tr>
<tr><td>expiry</td><td>the end epoch, at which a blob is no more available, and may be deleted.</td></tr>
