<p>The current Devnet release of Walrus and Walrus Sites is a developer preview, to showcase the
technology and solicit feedback from builders. All storage nodes and aggregators are operated by
Mysten Labs, all transactions are executed on the Sui Testnet and use Testnet SUI which has no
value. The state of the store can and will be wiped, at any point and possibly with no warning. Do
not rely on this developer preview for any production purposes, it comes with no availability or
persistence guarantees.</p>
<p>Also see the <a href="../tos.html">Devnet terms of service</a> under which this developer preview is made
available.</p>

<h2 id="features"><a class="header" href="#features">Features</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage and retrieval:</strong> Walrus supports storage operations to write and read blobs. It also
allows anyone to prove that a blob has been stored and is available for retrieval at a later
time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost efficiency:</strong> By utilizing advanced erasure coding, Walrus maintains storage costs at
approximately five times the size of the stored blobs, and encoded parts of each blob are stored
on each storage node. This is significantly more cost-effective than traditional full-replication
methods and much more robust against failures than protocols that only store each blob on a subset
of storage nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integration with the Sui blockchain:</strong> Walrus leverages <a href="https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui">Sui</a>
for coordination, attesting availability, and payments. Storage space is represented as a resource
on Sui, which can be owned, split, merged, and transferred. Stored blobs are also represented by
objects on Sui, which means that smart contracts can check whether a blob is available and for how
long.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexible access:</strong> Users can interact with Walrus through a command-line interface (CLI),
software development kits (SDKs), and web2 HTTP technologies. Walrus is designed to work well
with traditional caches and content distribution networks (CDNs), while ensuring all operations
can also be run using local tools to maximize decentralization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="architecture-and-operations"><a class="header" href="#architecture-and-operations">Architecture and operations</a></h2>
<p>Walrus's architecture ensures that content remains accessible and retrievable even when many
storage nodes are unavailable or malicious. Under the hood it uses modern error correction
techniques based on fast linear fountain codes, augmented to ensure resilience against Byzantine
faults, and a dynamically changing set of storage nodes. The core of Walrus remains simple, and
storage node management and blob certification leverages Sui smart contracts.</p>

<p>Walrus is an innovative decentralized storage network for blockchain apps and autonomous agents. The
Walrus storage system is being released today as a developer preview for Sui builders in order to
gather feedback. We expect a broad rollout to other web3 communities very soon!</p>
<p>Leveraging innovations in erasure coding, Walrus enables fast and robust encoding of unstructured
data blobs into smaller slivers distributed and stored over a network of storage nodes. A subset of
slivers can be used to rapidly reconstruct the original blob, even when up to two-thirds of the
slivers are missing. This is possible while keeping the replication factor down to a minimal 4x-5x,
similar to existing cloud-based services, but with the additional benefits of decentralization and
resilience to more widespread faults.</p>
<h2 id="the-replication-challenge"><a class="header" href="#the-replication-challenge">The Replication Challenge</a></h2>
<p>Sui is the most advanced blockchain system in relation to storage on validators, with innovations
such as a <a href="https://docs.sui.io/concepts/tokenomics/storage-fund">storage fund</a> that future-proofs
the cost of storing data on-chain. Nevertheless, Sui still requires complete data replication among
all validators, resulting in a replication factor of 100x or more in today’s Sui Mainnet. While this
is necessary for replicated computing and smart contracts acting on the state of the blockchain, it
is inefficient for simply storing unstructured data blobs, such as music, video, blockchain history,
etc.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-walrus-efficient-and-robust-decentralized-storage"><a class="header" href="#introducing-walrus-efficient-and-robust-decentralized-storage">Introducing Walrus: Efficient and Robust Decentralized Storage</a></h2>
<p>To tackle the challenge of high replication costs, Mysten Labs has developed Walrus, a decentralized
storage network offering exceptional data availability and robustness with a minimal replication
factor of 4x-5x. Walrus provides two key benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost-Effective Blob Storage:</strong> Walrus allows for the uploading of gigabytes of data at a time
with minimal cost, making it an ideal solution for storing large volumes of data. Walrus can do
this because the data blob is transmitted only once over the network, and storage nodes only
spend a fraction of resources compared to the blob size. As a result, the more storage nodes the
system has, the fewer resources each storage node uses per blob.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>High Availability and Robustness:</strong> Data stored on Walrus enjoys enhanced reliability and
availability under fault conditions. Data recovery is still possible even if two-thirds of the
storage nodes crash or come under adversarial control. Further, availability may be certified
efficiently without downloading the full blob.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Decentralized storage can take multiple forms in modern ecosystems. For instance, it offers better
guarantees for digital assets traded as NFTs. Unlike current designs that store data off-chain,
decentralized storage ensures users own the actual resource, not just metadata, mitigating risks of
data being taken down or misrepresented.</p>
<p>Additionally, decentralized storage is not only useful for storing data such as pictures or files
with high availability; it can also double as a low-cost data availability layer for rollups. Here,
sequencers can upload transactions on Walrus, and the rollup executor only needs to temporarily
reconstruct them for execution.</p>
<p>We also believe Walrus will accompany existing disaster recovery strategies for millions of
enterprise companies. Not only is Walrus low-cost, it also provides unmatched layers of data
availability, integrity, transparency, and resilience that centralized solutions by design cannot
offer.</p>
<p>Walrus is powered by the Sui Network and scales horizontally to hundreds or thousands of networked
decentralized storage nodes. This should enable Walrus to offer Exabytes of storage at costs
competitive with current centralized offerings, given the higher assurance and decentralization.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-walrus"><a class="header" href="#the-future-of-walrus">The Future of Walrus</a></h2>
<p>By releasing this developer preview we hope to share some of the design decisions with the
decentralized app developer community and gather feedback on the approach and the APIs for storing,
retrieving, and certifying blobs. In this developer preview, all storage nodes are operated by
Mysten Labs to help us understand use cases, fix bugs, and improve the performance of the software.</p>
<p>Future updates to Walrus will allow for dynamically changing the set of decentralized storage nodes,
as well as changing the mapping of what slivers are managed by each storage node. The available
operations and tools will also be expanded to cover more storage-related use cases. Many of these
functions will be designed with the feedback we gather in mind.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates on how Walrus will revolutionize data storage in the web3 ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-developers-build"><a class="header" href="#what-can-developers-build">What can developers build?</a></h2>
<p>As part of this developer preview, we provide a binary client (currently macOS, ubuntu) that can be
operated from the <a href="https://docs.walrus.site/usage/client-cli.html">command line interface</a>, a <a href="https://docs.walrus.site/usage/json-api.html">JSON
API</a>, and an <a href="https://docs.walrus.site/usage/web-api.html">HTTP
API</a>. We also offer the community an aggregator and
publisher service and a Devnet deployment of 10 storage nodes operated by Mysten Labs.</p>
<p>We hope developers will experiment with building applications that leverage the Walrus Decentralized
Store in a variety of ways. As examples, we hope to see the community build:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage of media for NFT or dapps:</strong> Walrus can directly store and serve media such as images,
sounds, sprites, videos, other game assets, etc. This is publicly available media that can be
accessed using HTTP requests at caches to create multimedia dapps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI-related use cases:</strong> Walrus can store clean data sets of training data, datasets with a known
and verified provenance, model weights, and proofs of correct training for AI models. Or it may be
used to store and ensure the availability and authenticity of an AI model output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage of long term archival of blockchain history:</strong> Walrus can be used as a lower-cost
decentralized store to store blockchain history. For Sui, this can include sequences of
checkpoints with all associated transaction and effects content, as well as historic snapshots of
the blockchain state, code, or binaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support availability for L2s:</strong> Walrus enables parties to certify the availability of blobs, as
required by L2s that need data to be stored and attested as available to all. This may also
include the availability of extra audit data such as validity proofs, zero-knowledge proofs of
correct execution, or large fraud proofs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support a full decentralized web experience:</strong> Walrus can host full decentralized web
experiences including all resources (such as js, css, html, and media). These can provide content
but also host the UX of dapps, enabling fully decentralized front- and back-ends on chain. It
brings the full "web" back into "web3".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support subscription models for media:</strong> Creators can store encrypted media on Walrus and only
provide access via decryption keys to parties that have paid a subscription fee or have paid for
content. (Note that Walrus provides the storage; encryption and decryption must be done off
Walrus).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are excited to see what else the web3 developer community can imagine!</p>

<h1 id="objectives-and-use-cases"><a class="header" href="#objectives-and-use-cases">Objectives and use cases</a></h1>
<p>Walrus supports operations to store and read blobs, and to prove and verify their availability.
It ensures content survives storage nodes suffering Byzantine faults and remains available and
retrievable. It provides APIs to access the stored content over a CLI, SDKs and over web2 HTTP
technologies, and supports content delivery infrastructures like caches and content distribution
networks (CDNs).</p>
<p>Under the hood, storage cost is a small fixed multiple of the size of blobs (around 5x). Advanced
erasure coding keeps the cost low, in contrast to the full replication of data traditional to
blockchains, such as the &gt;100x multiple for data stored in Sui objects. As a result, storage of much
bigger resources (up to several GiB) is possible on Walrus at substantially lower cost than on Sui
or other blockchains. Because encoded blobs are stored on all storage nodes, Walrus also provides
superior robustness than designs with a small amount of replicas storing the full blob.</p>
<p>Walrus uses the Sui chain for coordination and payments. Available storage is represented as Sui
objects that can be acquired, owned, split, merged, and transferred. Storage space can be tied to
a stored blob for a period of time, with the resulting Sui object used to prove
availability on chain in smart contracts, or off chain using light clients.</p>
<p>The <a href="design/./overview.html">next chapter</a> discusses the above operations relating to storage,
retrieval, and availability in detail.</p>
<p>In the future, we plan to include in Walrus some minimal governance to allow storage nodes to
change between storage epochs. Walrus is also compatible with periodic payments for continued
storage. We also plan to implement storage attestation based on challenges to get confidence
that blobs are stored or at least available. Walrus also allows light nodes that store small parts
of blobs to get rewards for proving availability and assisting recovery. We will cover these
topics in later documents. We also provide details of the encoding scheme in a separate document.</p>
<h2 id="non-objectives"><a class="header" href="#non-objectives">Non-objectives</a></h2>
<p>There are a few things that Walrus explicitly is not:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Walrus does not reimplement a CDN that might be geo-replicated or have less than tens of
milliseconds of latency. Instead, it ensures that traditional CDNs are usable and compatible with
Walrus caches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walrus does not re-implement a full smart contracts platform with consensus or execution. It
relies on Sui smart contracts when necessary, to manage Walrus resources and processes including
payments, storage epochs, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walrus supports storage of any blob, including encrypted blobs. However, Walrus itself is not the
distributed key management infrastructure that manages and distributed encryption or decryption
keys to support a full private storage eco-system. It can, however, provide the storage layer for
such infrastructures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="use-cases"><a class="header" href="#use-cases">Use cases</a></h2>
<p>App builders may use Walrus in conjunction with any L1 or L2 blockchains to build experiences that
require large amounts of data to be stored in a decentralized manner and possibly certified as
available:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage of media for NFT or dApps:</strong> Walrus can directly store and serve media such as images,
sounds, sprites, videos, other game assets, and so on. This is publicly available media that is
accessed using HTTP requests at caches to create multimedia dApps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI related use cases:</strong> Walrus can store clean data sets of training data, datasets with a
known and verified provenance, models, weights and proofs of correct training for AI models.
It can also store and ensure the availability of an AI model output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage of long term archival of blockchain history:</strong> Walrus can act as a lower-cost
decentralized store to store blockchain history. For Sui, this can include sequences of
checkpoints with all associated transaction and effects content, as well as historic snapshots
of the blockchain state, code, or binaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support availability for L2s:</strong> Walrus allows parties to certify the availability of blobs, as
required by L2s that need data to be stored and be attested as available to all. This may also

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support subscription models for media:</strong> Creators can store encrypted media on Walrus and only
provide access via decryption keys to parties that have paid a subscription fee or have paid for
content. Walrus provides the storage, encryption and decryption needs to happen off
the system.</p>

<h1 id="basic-architecture-and-security-assumptions"><a class="header" href="#basic-architecture-and-security-assumptions">Basic architecture and security assumptions</a></h1>
<p>The key actors in the Walrus architecture are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Users</strong> through <strong>clients</strong> want to store and read <strong>blobs</strong> identified by their <strong>blob ID</strong>.</p>
<p>These actors are ready to pay for service
when it comes to writes and non-best-effort reads. Users also want to prove
the <strong>availability</strong> of a blob to third parties without the cost of sending or receiving the full
blob.</p>
<p>Users might be malicious in various ways: they might not want to pay for services, prove the
availability of unavailable blobs, modify/delete blobs without authorization, try to
exhaust resources of storage nodes, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage nodes</strong> hold one or many <strong>shards</strong> within a <strong>storage epoch</strong>.</p>
<p>Each blob is erasure into encoded in many <strong>slivers</strong>. Slivers from each stored blob become part
of all shards. A shard at any storage epoch is associated with a storage node that actually stores
all slivers of the shard and is ready to serve them.</p>
<p>A Sui smart contract controls the assignment of shards to storage nodes within
<strong>storage epochs</strong>, and Walrus assumes that more than 2/3 of the
shards are managed by correct storage nodes within each storage epoch. This means that Walrus must
tolerate up to 1/3 of the shards managed by Byzantine storage nodes (approximately 1/3 of the
storage nodes being Byzantine) within each storage epoch and across storage epochs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All clients and storage nodes operate a blockchain client (specifically on Sui), and mediate
payments, resources (space), mapping of shards to storage nodes ,and metadata through blockchain
smart contracts. Users interact with the blockchain to acquire storage resources and upload
certificates for stored blobs. Storage nodes listen to the blockchain events to coordinate
their operations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Walrus supports any additional number of optional infrastructure actors that can operate in a
permissionless way:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Aggregators</strong> are clients that reconstruct blobs from slivers and make them available to users
over traditional web2 technologies (such as HTTP). They are optional in that end users may
reconstruct blobs directly or run a local aggregator to perform Walrus reads over web2
technologies locally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Caches</strong> are aggregators with additional caching functionality to decrease latency and reduce
load on storage nodes. Such cache infrastructures may also act as CDNs, split the cost of blob
reconstruction over many requests, be better connected, and so on. A client can always verify that
reads from such infrastructures are correct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Publishers</strong> are clients that help end users store a blob using web2 technologies,
using less bandwidth and custom logic.</p>
<p>In effect, they receive the blob to be published over traditional web2 protocols (like HTTP) and
run the Walrus store protocol on the end user's behalf. This includes encoding the blob into
slivers, distributing the slivers to storage nodes, collecting storage-node signatures and
aggregating them into a certificate, as well as all other on-chain actions.</p>
<p>They are optional in that a user can directly interact with Sui and
the storage nodes to store blobs. An end user can always verify that a publisher
performed their duties correctly by checking that an event associated with the
<strong><a href="design/./properties.html">point of availability</a></strong> for the blob exists on chain
and then either performing a read to see if Walrus returns the blob or encoding the blob
and comparing the result to the blob ID in the certificate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Aggregators, publishers, and end users are not considered trusted components of the system, and they
might deviate from the protocol arbitrarily. However, some of the security properties of Walrus only
hold for honest end users that use honest intermediaries (caches and publishers). Walrus provides a
means for end users to audit the correct operation of both caches and publishers.</p>

<h1 id="encoding-overheads-and-verification"><a class="header" href="#encoding-overheads-and-verification">Encoding, overheads, and verification</a></h1>
<p>The following list summarizes the basic encoding and cryptographic techniques used in Walrus:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_code">erasure code</a> encode algorithm takes a blob,
splits it into a number <span class="katex"><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03148em;">k</span></span></span></span> of symbols, and encodes it into <span class="katex"><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.5782em;vertical-align:-0.0391em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">&gt;</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03148em;">k</span></span></span></span> symbols in such a way that a
subset of these <span class="katex"><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span></span></span></span> symbols can be used to reconstruct the blob.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walrus uses a highly efficient erasure code and selects <span class="katex"><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03148em;">k</span></span></span></span> such that a third of symbols can be
used to reconstruct the blob by the decode algorithm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The encoding is <em>systematic</em>, meaning that some storage nodes hold part of the original blob,
allowing for fast random-access reads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All encoding and decoding operations are deterministic, and encoders have no discretion about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each blob, multiple symbols are combined into a <strong>sliver</strong>, which is then assigned to a shard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Storage nodes manage one or more shards, and corresponding slivers of each blob are distributed
to all the storage shards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The detailed encoding setup results in an expansion of the blob size by a factor of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">4.5</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">∼</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">5</span></span></span></span>.
This is independent of the number of shards and the number of storage nodes.</p>
<hr />
<p>Each blob is also associated with some metadata including a <strong>blob ID</strong> to allow verification:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The blob ID is computed as an authenticator of the set of all shard data and metadata (byte size,
encoding, blob hash).</p>
<p>Walrus hashes a sliver representation in each of the shards and adds the resulting hashes into a
Merkle tree. Then the root of the Merkle tree is the blob hash used to derive the blob ID that
identifies the blob in the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each storage node can use the blob ID to check if some shard data belongs to a blob using the
authenticated structure corresponding to the blob hash (Merkle tree). A successful check means
that the data is indeed as intended by the writer of the blob.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the writer of a blob might have incorrectly encoded a blob (by mistake or on purpose), any
party that reconstructs a blob ID from shard slivers must check that it encodes to the correct
blob ID. The same is necessary when accepting any blob claiming to be a specific blob ID.</p>
<p>This process involves re-encoding the blob using the erasure code, and deriving the blob ID again
to check that the blob matches. This prevents a malformed blob (incorrectly erasure coded) from
ever being read as a valid blob at any correct recipient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A set of slivers equal to the reconstruction threshold belonging to a blob ID that are either
inconsistent or lead to the reconstruction of a different ID represent an incorrect encoding. This
happens only if the user that encoded the blob was faulty or malicious and encoded it incorrectly.</p>
<p>Walrus can extract one symbol per sliver to form an inconsistency proof. Storage nodes can delete
slivers belonging to inconsistently encoded blobs, and upon request return either the
inconsistency proof or an inconsistency certificate posted on chain.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Walrus operations can be separated in <a href="design/./operations-sui.html">interactions with the Sui chain</a>, which

<h1 id="operations-on-sui"><a class="header" href="#operations-on-sui">Operations on Sui</a></h1>
<p>Walrus uses Sui smart contracts to coordinate storage operations as resources that have a lifetime,
and payments. Smart contracts also facilitate governance to determine the storage nodes holding each
storage shard. The following content outlines these operations and refers to them as part of the
read/write paths.</p>
<p>Metadata is the only blob element ever exposed to Sui or its validators, as the content
of blobs is always stored off chain on Walrus storage nodes and caches. The storage nodes or caches
do not have to overlap with any Sui infrastructure components (such as validators), and the storage
epochs can be of different lengths and not have the same start/end times as Sui epochs.</p>
<h2 id="storage-resource-life-cycle-on-sui"><a class="header" href="#storage-resource-life-cycle-on-sui">Storage resource life cycle on Sui</a></h2>
<p>A number of Sui smart contracts hold the metadata of the Walrus system and all its entities.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <strong>Walrus system object</strong> holds the committee of storage nodes for the current storage epoch. The
system object also holds the total available space on Walrus and the price per unit of storage (1
KiB).</p>
<p>These values are determined by 2/3 agreement between the storage nodes for the storage
epoch. Users can pay to purchase storage space for some time duration. These space resources can
be split, merged, and transferred. Later, they can be used to place a blob ID into Walrus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>storage fund</strong> holds funds for storing blobs over one or multiple storage epochs. When
purchasing storage space from the system object, users pay into the storage fund separated over
multiple storage epochs. Payments are made each epoch to storage nodes according to performance
(details follow).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A user acquires some storage through the contracts or transfer and can assign to it a blob ID,
signifying they want to store this blob ID into it. This emits a Move <strong>resource event</strong> that
storage nodes listen for to expect and authorize off-chain storage operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eventually a user holds an off-chain <strong>availability certificate</strong> from storage nodes for a blob
ID. The user <strong>uploads the certificate on chain</strong> to signal that the blob ID is available for an
availability period. The certificate is checked against the latest Walrus committee,
and an <strong>availability event</strong> is emitted for the blob ID if correct. This is the point of
availability for the blob.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At a later time, a certified blob's storage can be <strong>extended</strong> by adding a storage object to it
with a longer expiry period. This facility can be used by smart contracts to extend the
availability of blobs stored in perpetuity as long as funds exist to continue providing storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In case a blob ID is not correctly encoded, an <strong>inconsistency proof certificate</strong> can be uploaded
on chain at a later time. This action emits an <strong>inconsistent blob event</strong>, signaling that the
blob ID read results always return <code>None</code>. This indicates that its slivers can be deleted by
storage nodes, except for an indicator to return <code>None</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Users writing to Walrus, need to perform Sui transactions to acquire storage and certify blobs.
Users creating or consuming proofs for attestations of blob availability read the chain
only to prove or verify emission of events. Nodes read
the blockchain to get committee metadata only once per epoch, and then request slivers directly
from storage nodes by blob ID to perform reads on Walrus resources.</p>
<h2 id="governance-operations-on-sui"><a class="header" href="#governance-operations-on-sui">Governance operations on Sui</a></h2>
<p>Each Walrus storage epoch is represented by the Walrus system object that contains a storage
committee and various metadata or storage nodes, like the mapping between shards and storage nodes,
available space, and current costs.</p>
<p>Users can go to the system object for the period and <strong>buy some storage</strong> amount for one or more
storage epochs. At each storage epoch there is a price for storage, and the payment provided becomes
part of a <strong>storage fund</strong> for all the storage epochs that span the storage bought. There is a
maximum number of storage epochs in the future for which storage can be bought (approximately 2
years). Storage is a resource that can be split, merged, and transferred.</p>
<p>At the end of the storage epoch, part of the funds in the <strong>storage fund need to be allocated to
storage nodes</strong>. The idea here is for storage nodes to perform light audits of each other,
and suggest which nodes are to be paid based on the performance of these audits.</p>

<p>While Walrus operations happen off Sui, they might interact with the blockchain flows defining the
resource life cycle.</p>
<h2 id="write-paths"><a class="header" href="#write-paths">Write paths</a></h2>
<p><img src="design/../assets/WriteFlow.png" alt="Write paths of Walrus" /></p>
<p>Systems overview of writes, illustrated in the previous image:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A user acquires a storage resource of appropriate size and duration on chain, either by directly
buying it on the Walrus system object or a secondary market. A user can split, merge, and
transfer owned storage resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When users want to store a blob, they first erasure code it and compute the
blob ID. Then they can perform the following steps themselves, or use a publisher to perform steps
on their behalf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user goes on chain (Sui) and updates a storage resource to register the blob ID with the
desired size and lifetime. This emits an event, received by storage nodes. After the
user receives they then continue the upload.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user sends the blob metadata to all storage nodes and each of the blob slivers to the storage
node that currently manages the corresponding shard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A storage node managing a shard receives a sliver and checks it against the blob ID.
It also checks that there is a blob resource with the blob ID that is authorized to store
a blob. If correct, the storage node then signs a statement that it holds the sliver for blob ID
(and metadata) and returns it to the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user puts together the signatures returned from storage nodes into an availability certificate
and submits it to the chain. When the certificate is verified on chain, an availability event for
the blob ID is emitted, and all other storage nodes seek to download any missing shards for the
blob ID. This event emitted by Sui is the <a href="design/./properties.html">point of availability (PoA)</a> for the
blob ID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the PoA, and without user involvement, storage nodes sync and recover any missing metadata
and slivers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The user waits for 2/3 of shard signatures to return to create the certificate of
availability. The rate of the code is below 1/3, allowing for reconstruction even if only 1/3 of
shards return the sliver for a read. Because at most 1/3 of the storage nodes can fail, this ensures
reconstruction if a reader requests slivers from all storage nodes. The full process can
be mediated by a publisher that receives a blob and drives the process to completion.</p>
<h2 id="refresh-availability"><a class="header" href="#refresh-availability">Refresh availability</a></h2>
<p>Because no content data is required to refresh the duration of storage, refresh is conducted fully
on chain within the protocol. To request an extension to the availability of a blob, a user provides
an appropriate storage resource. Upon success this emits an event that storage nodes receive to
extend the time for which each sliver is stored.</p>
<h2 id="inconsistent-resource-flow"><a class="header" href="#inconsistent-resource-flow">Inconsistent resource flow</a></h2>
<p>When a correct storage node tries to reconstruct a sliver for a blob past <a href="design/./properties.html">PoA</a>,
this may fail if the encoding of the blob was incorrect. In this case, the storage node can instead
extract an inconsistency proof for the blob ID. It then uses the proof to create an inconsistency
certificate and upload it on chain.</p>
<p>The flow is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A storage node fails to reconstruct a sliver, and instead computes an inconsistency proof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The storage node sends the blob ID and inconsistency proof to all storage nodes of the Walrus
epoch. The storage nodes verify the proof and sign it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The storage node who found the inconsistency aggregates the signatures into an inconsistency
certificate and sends it to the Walrus smart contract, which verifies it and emits a inconsistent
resource event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receiving an inconsistent resource event, correct storage nodes delete sliver data for the
blob ID and record in the metadata to return <code>None</code> for the blob ID for the
<a href="design/./properties.html">availability period</a>. No storage attestation challenges are issued for this
blob ID.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div>
<p>A blob ID that is inconsistent always resolves to <code>None</code> upon reading because
the read process re-encodes the received blob to check that the blob ID is correctly derived from a
consistent encoding. This means that an inconsistency proof reveals only a true fact to storage
nodes (that do not otherwise run decoding), and does not change the output of read in any case.</p>
<p>However, partial reads leveraging the systematic nature of the encoding might successfully return
partial reads for inconsistently encoded files. Thus, if consistency and availability of reads is
important, dApps should do full reads rather than partial reads.</p>

<h2 id="read-paths"><a class="header" href="#read-paths">Read paths</a></h2>
<p>A user can read stored blobs either directly or through an aggregator/cache. The operations are the
same for direct user access, for aggregators, and caches in case of cache misses. In practice, most
reads happen through caches for blobs that are hot and do not result in requests to storage nodes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The reader gets the metadata for the blob ID from any storage node, and authenticates it using
the blob ID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reader then sends a request to the storage nodes for the shards corresponding to the blob ID
and waits for <span class="katex"><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span><span class="mbin">+</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span></span></span></span> to respond. Sufficient requests are sent in parallel to ensure low latency
for reads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reader authenticates the slivers returned with the blob ID, reconstructs the blob, and decides
whether the contents are a valid blob or inconsistent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optionally, for a cache, the result is cached and can be served without reconstruction until it is
evicted from the cache. Requests for the blob to the cache return the blob contents, or a proof
that the blob is inconsistently encoded.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="challenge-mechanism-for-storage-attestation"><a class="header" href="#challenge-mechanism-for-storage-attestation">Challenge mechanism for storage attestation</a></h2>
<p>During an epoch, a correct storage node challenges all shards to provide symbols for blob slivers
past PoA:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The list of available blobs for the epoch is determined by the sequence of Sui events up
to the past epoch. Inconsistent blobs are not challenged, and a record proving this status
can be returned instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A challenge sequence is determined by providing a seed to the challenged shard. The sequence is
then computed based both on the seed <strong>and</strong> the content of each challenged blob ID. This creates
a sequential read dependency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The response to the challenge provides the sequence of shard contents for the blob IDs in a
timely manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The challenger node uses thresholds to determine whether the challenge was passed, and reports
the result on chain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The challenge/response communication is authenticated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Challenges provide some reassurance that the storage node can actually recover shard data in a
probabilistic manner, avoiding storage nodes getting payment without any evidence they might
retrieve shard data. The sequential nature of the challenge and some reasonable timeout also ensures
that the process is timely.</p>

<p>The properties below hold true subject to the assumption that for all storage epochs 2/3 of shards
are operated by storage nodes that faithfully and correctly follow the Walrus protocol.</p>
<p>As described <a href="design/./encoding.html">before</a>, each blob is encoded into slivers using an erasure code and a
blob ID is cryptographically derived. For a given blob ID there is a <strong>point of availability (PoA)</strong>
and an <strong>availability period</strong>, observable through an event on the Sui chain.</p>
<p>The following properties relate to the PoA:</p>
<ul>
<li>After the PoA, for a blob ID, any correct user that performs a read within the availability period
will eventually terminate and get a value <span class="katex"><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">V</span></span></span></span> which is either the blob contents <span class="katex"><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">F</span></span></span></span> or <code>None</code>.</li>

</ul>
<p>Some assurance properties ensure the correct internal processes of Walrus storage nodes.
For the purposes of defining these, an <strong>inconsistency proof</strong> proves that a blob ID was
stored by a user that incorrectly encoded a blob.</p>
<ul>
<li>After the PoA and for a blob ID stored by a correct user, a storage node is always able to recover
the correct slivers for its shards for this blob ID.</li>
<li>After the PoA, if a correct storage node cannot recover a sliver, it can produce an inconsistency
proof for the blob ID.</li>
<li>If a blob ID is stored by a correct user, an inconsistently proof cannot be derived for it.</li>
<li>A read by a correct user for a blob ID for which an inconsistency proof may exist returns <code>None</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that there is no delete operation and a blob ID past the PoA will be available for the full
availability period.</p>

<p>The current Devnet release of Walrus and Walrus Sites is a developer preview, to showcase the
technology and solicit feedback from builders. All storage nodes and aggregators are operated by
Mysten Labs, all transactions are executed on the Sui Testnet and use Testnet SUI which has no
value. The state of the store can and will be wiped, at any point and possibly with no warning. Do
not rely on this developer preview for any production purposes, it comes with no availability or
persistence guarantees.</p>

<h1 id="components"><a class="header" href="#components">Components</a></h1>
<p>From a developer perspective, some Walrus components are objects and smart contracts on
Sui, and some components are Walrus-specific binaries and services. As a rule, Sui is used to
manage blob and storage node metadata, while Walrus-specific services are used to store and
read blob contents, which can be very large.</p>
<p>Walrus defines a number of objects and smart contracts on Sui:</p>
<ul>
<li>A shared <em>system object</em> records and manages the current committee of storage nodes.</li>
<li><em>Storage resources</em> represent empty storage space that may be used to store blobs.</li>
<li><em>Blob resources</em> represent blobs being registered and certified as stored.</li>
<li>Changes to these objects emit <em>Walrus-related events</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Walrus system object ID can be found in the Walrus <code>client_config.yaml</code> file (see
<a href="dev-guide/../usage/setup.html#configuration">Configuration</a>). You may use any Sui explorer to look at its
content, as well as explore the content of blob objects. There is more information about these in
the <a href="dev-guide/sui-struct.html">quick reference to the Walrus Sui structures</a>.</p>
<p>Walrus is also composed of a number of Walrus-specific services and binaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>A client (binary) can be executed locally and provides a
<a href="dev-guide/../usage/client-cli.html">Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>, a <a href="dev-guide/../usage/json-api.html">JSON API</a>
and an <a href="dev-guide/../usage/web-api.html">HTTP API</a> to perform Walrus operations.</li>
<li>Aggregator services allow reading blobs via HTTP requests.</li>
<li>Publisher services are used store blobs to Walrus.</li>
<li>A set of storage nodes store encoded blobs. These nodes form the decentralized
storage infrastructure of Walrus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aggregators, publishers, and other services use the client APIs to interact with Walrus. End users
of services using Walrus interact with the store via custom services, aggregators, or publishers
that expose HTTP APIs to avoid the need to run locally a binary client.</p>

<p>Walrus stores blobs across storage nodes in an <a href="dev-guide/../design/encoding.html">encoded form</a>, and refers
to blobs by their <em>blob ID</em>. The blob ID is deterministically derived from the content of a blob
and the Walrus configuration. The blob ID of two files with the same content will be the same.</p>
<p>You can derive the blob ID of a file locally using the command: <code>walrus blob-id &lt;file path&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Walrus may be used to <strong>store a blob</strong>, via the native client APIs or a publisher.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p><strong>All blobs stored in Walrus are public and discoverable by all.</strong> Therefore you must not use Walrus
to store anything that contains secrets or private data without additional measures to protect
confidentiality.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Under the hood a number of operations happen both on Sui as well as on storage nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The client or publisher encodes the blob and derives a <em>blob ID</em> that identifies the blob. This
is a <code>u256</code> often encoded as a URL-safe base64 string.</li>
<li>A transaction is executed on Sui to purchase some storage from the system object, and then to
<em>register the blob ID</em> occupying this storage. Client APIs return the <em>Sui blob object ID</em>. The
transactions use SUI to purchase storage and pay for gas.</li>
<li>Encoded slivers of the blob are distributed to all storage nodes. They each sign a receipt.</li>
<li>Signed receipts are aggregated and submitted to the Sui blob object to <em>certify the blob</em>.
Certifying a blob emits a Sui event with the blob ID and the period of availability.</li>
</ul>
<p>A blob is considered available on Walrus once the corresponding Sui blob object has been
certified in the final step. The steps involved in a store operation can be executed by the binary
client, or a publisher that accepts and publishes blobs via HTTP.</p>
<p>Walrus currently allows the storage of blobs up to a maximum size that may be determined
through the <a href="dev-guide/../usage/client-cli.html#walrus-system-information"><code>walrus info</code></a> CLI command. The
maximum blob size is currently 957 MiB. You may store larger blobs by splitting them into
smaller chunks.</p>
<p>Blobs are stored for a certain number of <em>epochs</em>, as specified at the time they were stored. Walrus
storage nodes ensure that within these epochs a read succeeds. The Walrus Devnet only uses a single
epoch today, and blobs uploaded will be available in that single epoch (until the Devnet is wiped).
Future devnets may span across multiple epochs.</p>
<h2 id="read"><a class="header" href="#read">Read</a></h2>
<p>Walrus can also be used to <strong>read a blob</strong> after it is stored by providing its blob ID.
A read is executed by performing the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>The system object on Sui is read to determine the Walrus storage node committee.</li>
<li>A number of storage nodes are queried for blob metadata and the slivers they store.</li>
<li>The blob is reconstructed from the recovered slivers and checked against the blob ID.</li>
</ul>
<p>The steps involved in the read operation are performed by the binary client, or the aggregator
service that exposes an HTTP interface to read blobs. Reads are extremely resilient and will succeed
in recovering the blob in all cases even if up to one-third of storage nodes are unavailable. In
most cases, after synchronization is complete, blob can be read even if two-thirds of storage nodes
are down.</p>
<h2 id="certify-availability"><a class="header" href="#certify-availability">Certify Availability</a></h2>
<p>Walrus can be used to <strong>certify the availability of a blob</strong> using Sui. Checking that this happened
may currently be done in 3 different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Sui SDK read can be
used to authenticate the certified blob event emitted when the blob ID was certified on Sui. The
client <code>walrus blob-status</code> command may be used to identify the event ID that needs to be checked.</li>
<li>A Sui SDK read may be
used to authenticate the Sui blob object corresponding to the blob ID, and check it is certified.</li>
<li>A Sui smart contract can read the blob object on Sui (or a reference to it) to check
is is certified.</li>
</ul>
<p>The underlying protocol of the
<a href="https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-light-client">Sui light client</a>
returns digitally signed evidence for emitted events
or objects, and can be used by off-line or non-interactive applications as a proof of availability
for the blob ID for a certain number of epochs.</p>
<p>Once a blob is certified, Walrus will ensure that sufficient slivers will always be
available on storage nodes to recover it within the specified epochs.</p>

<p>You can interact with Walrus purely through the client CLI, and JSON or HTTP APIs provided, without
querying or executing transactions on Sui directly. However, Walrus uses Sui to manage its metadata

on Sui.</p>

<h2 id="blob-and-storage-objects"><a class="header" href="#blob-and-storage-objects">Blob and storage objects</a></h2>
<p>Walrus blobs are represented as Sui objects of type <code>Blob</code>. A blob is first registered, indicating
that the storage nodes should expect slivers from a Blob ID to be stored. Then a blob is certified,
indicating that a sufficient number of slivers have been stored to guarantee the blob's
availability. When a blob is certified, its <code>certified_epoch</code> field contains the epoch in which it
was certified.</p>
<p>A <code>Storage</code> object is always associated with a <code>Blob</code> object, reserving enough space for
a long enough period for the blob's storage. A certified blob is available for the period the
underlying storage resource guarantees storage.</p>
<p>Concretely, <code>Blob</code> and <code>Storage</code> objects have the following fields, which can be read through the
Sui SDKs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-move">/// The blob structure represents a blob that has been registered to with some
/// storage, and then may eventually be certified as being available in the
/// system.
public struct Blob has key, store {
    id: UID,
    stored_epoch: u64,
    blob_id: u256,
    size: u64,
    erasure_code_type: u8,
    certified_epoch: option::Option&lt;u64&gt;, // The epoch first certified,
                                          // or None if not certified.
    storage: Storage,
}

/// Reservation for storage for a given period, which is inclusive start,

public struct Storage has key, store {
    id: UID,
    start_epoch: u64,
    end_epoch: u64,
    storage_size: u64,
}
</code></pre>
<p>All fields of <code>Blob</code> and <code>Storage</code> objects can be read using the expected functions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-move">// Blob functions

<p>At this stage of the project, our Walrus code is not yet public. Instead, we provide a pre-compiled
<code>walrus</code> client binary for macOS (Intel and Apple CPUs) and Ubuntu, which supports different usage
patterns (see <a href="usage/./interacting.html">the next chapter</a>). This chapter describes the
<a href="usage/setup.html#prerequisites">prerequisites</a>, <a href="usage/setup.html#installation">installation</a>, and <a href="usage/setup.html#configuration">configuration</a>

<a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="usage/setup.html#admonition-note"></a>
</div>
<div>
<p>Note that our Walrus Devnet uses Sui <strong>Testnet</strong> for coordination.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="prerequisites"><a class="header" href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>
<p>Interacting with Walrus requires a valid Sui <strong>Testnet</strong> wallet with some amount of SUI tokens. The
easiest way to set this up is via the Sui CLI; see the <a href="https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install">installation
instructions</a> in the Sui
documentation.</p>
<p>After installing the Sui CLI, you need to set up a Testnet wallet by running <code>sui client</code>, which
prompts you to set up a new configuration. Make sure to point it to Sui Testnet, you can use the
full node at <code>https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443</code> for this. See
<a href="https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/connect">here</a> for further details.</p>
<p>If you already have a Sui wallet configured, you can directly set up the Testnet environment (if you
don't have it yet),</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">sui client new-env --alias testnet --rpc https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443
</code></pre>
<p>and switch the active environment to it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">sui client switch --env testnet
</code></pre>
<p>After this, you should get something like this (everything besides the <code>testnet</code> line is optional):</p>
<pre><code class="language-terminal">$ sui client envs
╭──────────┬─────────────────────────────────────┬────────╮
│ alias    │ url                                 │ active │

│ mainnet  │ https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443 │        │
╰──────────┴─────────────────────────────────────┴────────╯
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, make sure you have at least 2 separate gas coins, with at least 1 SUI each. You can obtain
these coins from the Testnet faucet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">sui client faucet &amp;&amp; sui client faucet
</code></pre>
<p>After some seconds, you should see your new SUI coins:</p>
<pre><code class="language-terminal">$ sui client gas

<p>The system-wide wallet will be used by Walrus if no other path is specified. If you want to use a
different Sui wallet, you can specify this in the <a href="usage/setup.html#configuration">Walrus configuration file</a> or
when <a href="usage/./interacting.html">running the CLI</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>You can download the latest build from our Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket (correctly setting the

</div>
</div>
<h3 id="binary-custom-path"><a class="header" href="#binary-custom-path">Custom path (optional)</a></h3>
<p>Instead of <code>~/.local/bin</code>, you can place the binary in any other directory you like. You need to
either make sure to add that directory to your <code>$PATH</code> or always call the binary as
<code>/full/path/to/walrus</code>.</p>
<h3 id="previous-versions-optional"><a class="header" href="#previous-versions-optional">Previous versions (optional)</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the latest version of the <code>walrus</code> binary, the GCS bucket also contains previous

<h2 id="configuration"><a class="header" href="#configuration">Configuration</a></h2>
<p>A single parameter is required to configure Walrus, namely the ID of the <a href="usage/../dev-guide/sui-struct.html#system-information">system
object</a> on Sui. You can create your client
configuration as follows:</p>
<!-- TODO: Make sure this is consistent with our default paths. -->
<pre><code class="language-sh">mkdir ~/.walrus
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/mysten-walrus-binaries/walrus-configs/client_config.yaml \
     -o ~/.walrus/client_config.yaml
</code></pre>
<h3 id="config-custom-path"><a class="header" href="#config-custom-path">Custom path (optional)</a></h3>
<p>By default, the Walrus client will look for the <code>client_config.yaml</code> configuration file in the
current directory or in <code>~/.walrus/</code>, but you can place the file anywhere and name it anything you
like; in this case you need to use the <code>--config</code> option when running the <code>walrus</code> binary.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-configuration-optional"><a class="header" href="#advanced-configuration-optional">Advanced configuration (optional)</a></h3>
<p>The configuration file currently supports the following parameters:</p>

<p>Detailed usage information is available through</p>

argument: <code>walrus info --dev</code>.</p>
<h2 id="storing-querying-status-and-reading-blobs"><a class="header" href="#storing-querying-status-and-reading-blobs">Storing, querying status, and reading blobs</a></h2>
<p>Storing blobs on Walrus can be achieved through the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">walrus store &lt;some file&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The store command takes a CLI argument <code>--epochs &lt;EPOCHS&gt;</code> (or <code>-e</code>) indicating the number of
epochs the blob should be stored for. This defaults to 1 epoch, namely the current one.</p>
<p>If the blob is already stored on Walrus for a sufficient number of epochs the command does not store
it again. However, this behavior can be overwritten with the <code>--force</code> (or <code>-f</code>) CLI option, which
stores the blob again and creates a fresh blob object on Sui belonging to the wallet address.</p>
<p>The status of a blob can be queried through one of the following commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">walrus blob-status --blob-id &lt;BLOB_ID&gt;
walrus blob-status --file &lt;FILE&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This returns whether the blob is stored and its availability period. If you specify a file with the
<code>--file</code> option,the CLI re-encodes the content of the file and derives the blob ID before checking
the status.</p>
<p>When the blob is available, the <code>blob-status</code> command also returns the <code>BlobCertified</code> Sui event ID,
which consists of a transaction ID and a sequence number in the events emitted by the transaction.
The existence of this event certifies the availability of the blob.</p>
<p>Reading blobs from Walrus can be achieved through the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">walrus read &lt;some blob ID&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>By default the blob data is written to the standard output. The <code>--out &lt;OUT&gt;</code> CLI option (or <code>-o</code>)
can be used to specify an output file name. The <code>--rpc-url &lt;URL&gt;</code> (or <code>-r</code>) may be used to specify
a Sui RPC node to use instead of the one set in the wallet configuration or the default one.</p>
<h2 id="changing-the-default-configuration"><a class="header" href="#changing-the-default-configuration">Changing the default configuration</a></h2>
<p>Use the <code>--config</code> option to specify a custom path to the
<a href="usage/../usage/setup.html#configuration">configuration location</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>--wallet &lt;WALLET&gt;</code> argument may be used to specify a non-standard Sui wallet configuration
file. And a <code>--gas-budget &lt;GAS_BUDGET&gt;</code> argument may be used to change the maximum amount of Sui (in
MIST) that the command is allowed to use.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting"><a class="header" href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h2>
<p>If you get an error like "the specified Walrus system object does not exist", make sure your wallet
is set up for Sui <strong>Testnet</strong> and you use the latest <a href="usage/./setup.html#configuration">configuration</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.4/dist/katex.min.css">
<h1 id="json-mode"><a class="header" href="#json-mode">JSON mode</a></h1>
<p>All Walrus client commands (except, currently, the <code>info</code> command) are also available in JSON mode.
In this mode, all the command-line flags of the original CLI command can be specified in JSON
format. The JSON mode therefore simplifies programmatic access to the CLI.</p>
<p>For example, to store a blob, run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">walrus json \
    '{
        "config": "path/to/client_config.yaml",
        "command": {
            "store": {
                "file": "README.md"
            }
        }
    }'
</code></pre>
<p>Or, to read a blob knowing the blob ID:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">walrus json \
    '{
        "config": "path/to/client_config.yaml",
        "command": {
            "read": {
                "blobId": "4BKcDC0Ih5RJ8R0tFMz3MZVNZV8b2goT6_JiEEwNHQo"
            }
        }
    }'
</code></pre>
<p>All options, default values, and commands are equal to those of the "standard" CLI mode, except that
they are written in "camelCase" instead of "kebab-case".</p>
<p>The <code>json</code> command also accepts input from <code>stdin</code>.</p>
<p>The output of a <code>json</code> command will itself be JSON-formatted, again to simplify parsing the results
in a programmatic way. For example, the JSON output can be piped to the <code>jq</code> command for parsing and
manually extracting relevant fields.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.4/dist/katex.min.css">
<h1 id="client-daemon-mode--http-api"><a class="header" href="#client-daemon-mode--http-api">Client Daemon mode &amp; HTTP API</a></h1>
<p>In addition to the CLI and JSON modes, the Walrus client offers a <em>daemon mode</em>. In this mode, it
runs a simple web server offering HTTP interfaces to store and read blobs in an <em>aggregator</em> and
<em>publisher</em> role respectively. We also offer
<a href="usage/web-api.html#public-services">public aggregator and publisher services</a> to try the Walrus HTTP APIs without
the need to run a local client.</p>
<h2 id="local-daemon"><a class="header" href="#local-daemon">Starting the daemon locally</a></h2>
<p>You can run the daemon with the following command, to offer both an aggregator and publisher on
the same address (<code>127.0.0.1</code>) and port (<code>31415</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">walrus daemon -b "127.0.0.1:31415"
</code></pre>
<p>Or you may run the aggregator and publisher processes separately on different addresses/ports:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">walrus aggregator -b "127.0.0.1:31415" # run an aggregator to read blobs
walrus publisher -b "127.0.0.1:31416" # run a publisher to store blobs
</code></pre>
<p>The aggregator provides all read APIs, the publisher all the store APIs, and the daemon provides
both.</p>
<div id="admonition-warning" class="admonition admonish-warning" role="note" aria-labelledby="admonition-warning-title">

<div id="admonition-warning-title">
<p>Warning</p>
</div>
<a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="usage/web-api.html#admonition-warning"></a>
</div>
<div>
<p>While the aggregator does not perform Sui on-chain actions, and therefore consumes no gas, the
publisher does perform actions on-chain and will consume gas. It is therefore important to ensure
only authorized parties may access it, or other measures to manage gas costs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="public-services"><a class="header" href="#public-services">Using a public aggregator or publisher</a></h2>
<p>For some use cases (e.g., a public website), or to just try out the HTTP API, a publicly accessible
aggregator and/or publisher is required. For your convenience, we provide these at the following
hosts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregator: <code>https://aggregator-devnet.walrus.space</code></li>
<li>Publisher: <code>https://publisher-devnet.walrus.space</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Our publisher is currently limiting requests to 10 MiB. If you want to upload larger files, you need
to <a href="usage/web-api.html#local-daemon">run your own publisher</a> or use the <a href="usage/./client-cli.html">CLI</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the publisher consumes (Testnet) Sui on the service side, and a Mainnet deployment would
likely not be able to provide uncontrolled public access to publishing without requiring some
authentication and compensation for the Sui used.</p>
<h2 id="http-api-usage"><a class="header" href="#http-api-usage">HTTP API Usage</a></h2>
<p>For the following examples, we assume you set the <code>AGGREGATOR</code> and <code>PUBLISHER</code> environment variables
to your desired aggregator and publisher, respectively. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">AGGREGATOR=https://aggregator-devnet.walrus.space
PUBLISHER=https://publisher-devnet.walrus.space
</code></pre>
<h3 id="store-1"><a class="header" href="#store-1">Store</a></h3>
<p>You can interact with the daemon through simple HTTP PUT requests. For example, with
<a href="https://curl.se">cURL</a>, you can store blobs using a publisher or daemon as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">curl -X PUT "$PUBLISHER/v1/store" -d "some string" # store the string `some string` for 1 storage epoch
curl -X PUT "$PUBLISHER/v1/store?epochs=5" --upload-file "some/file" # store file `some/file` for 5 storage epochs
</code></pre>
<p>The store HTTP API end points return information about the blob stored in JSON format. When a blob
is stored for the first time, a <code>newlyCreated</code> field contains information about the
new blob:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ curl -X PUT "$PUBLISHER/v1/store" -d "some other string"
{
  "newlyCreated": {
    "blobObject": {
      "id": "0xd765d11848cbac5b1f6eec2fbeb343d4558cbe8a484a00587f9ef5385d64d235",

<p>The information returned is the content of the <a href="usage/../dev-guide/sui-struct.html">Sui blob object</a>.</p>
<p>When the aggregator finds a certified blob with the same blob ID and a sufficient validity period,
it returns a <code>alreadyCertified</code> JSON structure:</p>

<p>The field <code>event</code> returns the <a href="usage/../dev-guide/sui-struct.html">Sui event ID</a> that can be used to

<h3 id="read-1"><a class="header" href="#read-1">Read</a></h3>
<p>Blobs may be read from an aggregator or daemon using HTTP GET. For example, the following cURL

<pre><code class="language-sh">curl "$AGGREGATOR/v1/&lt;some blob ID&gt; -o &lt;some file name&gt;"
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively you may print the contents of a blob in the terminal with the cURL command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">curl "$AGGREGATOR/v1/&lt;some blob ID&gt;

<h1 id="introduction-to-walrus-sites"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-walrus-sites">Introduction to Walrus Sites</a></h1>
<p><em>Walrus Sites</em> are "web"-sites that use Sui and Walrus as their underlying technology. They are a
prime example of how Walrus can be used to build new and exciting decentralized applications. Anyone
can build and deploy a Walrus Site and make it accessible to the world! Funnily, this documentation
is itself available as a Walrus Site at <a href="https://docs.walrus.site/walrus-sites/intro.html">https://docs.walrus.site/walrus-sites/intro.html</a> (if you
aren't there already).</p>
<p>At a high level, here are some of the most exciting features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing a site does not require managing servers or complex configurations; just provide the
source files (produced by your favorite web framework), publish them to Walrus Sites using the
<a href="walrus-sites/./overview.html#the-site-builder">site-builder tool</a>, and you are done!</li>
<li>Sites can be linked to from ordinary Sui objects. This feature enables, for example, creating an
NFT collection in which <em>every single NFT</em> has a <em>personalized website dedicated to it</em>.</li>
<li>Walrus Sites are owned by addresses on Sui and can be exchanged, shared, and updated thanks to
Sui's flexible programming model. This means, among other things, that Walrus Sites can leverage
the <a href="https://suins.io/">SuiNS</a> naming system to have human-readable names. No more messing around
with DNS!</li>
<li>Thanks to Walrus's decentralization and extremely high data availability, there is no risk of
having your site wiped for no reason.</li>
<li>Since they live on Walrus, these sites cannot have a backend in the traditional sense, and can be
therefore considered "static" sites. However, the developer can integrate with Sui-compatible
wallets and harness Sui's programmability to add backend functionality to Walrus Sites!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="show-me"><a class="header" href="#show-me">Show me</a></h2>
<p>To give you a very high-level intuition of how Walrus Sites work, let's look at an example: A simple
NFT collection on Sui that has a frontend dApp to mint the NFTs hosted on Walrus Sites, and in
which <em>each NFT</em> has a <em>specific, personalized Walrus Site</em>.</p>
<p>You can check out the mint page at <a href="https://flatland.walrus.site/">https://flatland.walrus.site/</a>. This site is served to your
browser through the Walrus Site <em>Portal</em> <a href="https://walrus.site">https://walrus.site</a>. While the Portal's operation is
explained in a <a href="walrus-sites/./portal.html">later section</a>, consider for now that there can be many Portals (hosted
by whoever wants to have their own, and even on <code>localhost</code>). Further, the only function of the
Portal is to provide the browser with some code (specifically, a service worker) that allows it to
fetch the Walrus Site from Sui and Walrus.</p>
<p>If you have a Sui wallet with some Testnet SUI, you can try and "mint a new Flatlander" from the
site. This creates an NFT from the collection and shows you two links: one to the explorer, and one
to the "Flatlander site". This latter site is a special Walrus Site that exists only for that NFT,
and has special characteristics (the background color, the image, ...) that are based on the
contents of the NFT.</p>
<p>The URL to this per-NFT site looks something like this:
<code>https://4egmmrw9izzjn0dm2lkd3k0l8phk386z60ub1tpdc1jswbb5dr.walrus.site/</code>. You'll notice that the
domain remains <code>walrus.site</code>, but the subdomain is a long and random-looking string. This string is
actually the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base36">Base36</a> encoding of the object ID of the NFT,
which is
<a href="https://suiscan.xyz/testnet/object/0xb09b312b28049467dd6173b6cebb60ed5fe3046883e248632bf9fb20b7dbdaff">0xb09b312b...</a>.</p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walrus Sites are served through a Portal; in this case, <code>https://walrus.site</code>. There can be many
Portals, and anyone can host one.</li>
<li>The subdomain on the URL points to a specific object on Sui that allows the browser to fetch and
render the site resources. This pointer can be
<ul>
<li>a SuiNS name, such as <code>flatland</code> in <code>https://flatland.walrus.site</code>, or</li>
<li>the Base36 encoding of a the Sui object ID, such as <code>0xb09b312b...</code> in the example above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This section describes the steps necessary to setup the Walrus Sites' <code>site-builder</code> tool and
prepare your environment for development.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites-1"><a class="header" href="#prerequisites-1">Prerequisites</a></h2>
<p>Before you start, make sure you</p>
<ul>
<li>have a recent version of <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">Rust</a> installed;</li>
<li>have <code>git</code> installed; and</li>
<li>followed all <a href="walrus-sites/../usage/setup.html">Walrus setup instructions</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, follow these additional setup steps.</p>
<h2 id="clone-the-repository-and-build-the-site-builder-tool"><a class="header" href="#clone-the-repository-and-build-the-site-builder-tool">Clone the repository and build the <code>site-builder</code> tool</a></h2>
<p>First, clone and enter the Walrus Sites repo from <a href="https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-sites">https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-sites</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">git clone https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-sites.git
cd walrus-sites
</code></pre>
<p>Then, build the release version of the site builder:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo build --release
</code></pre>
<p>After the build process completes, you are ready to run the site builder:</p>
<pre><code class="language-terminal">$ ./target/release/site-builder
Usage: site-builder [OPTIONS] &lt;COMMAND&gt;

Commands:
  publish  Publish a new site on Sui
  update   Update an existing site
  convert  Convert an object ID in hex format to the equivalent Base36
               format
  sitemap  Show the pages composing the Walrus site at the given object ID
  help     Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

⋮
</code></pre>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.4/dist/katex.min.css">
<h1 id="publishing-a-walrus-site"><a class="header" href="#publishing-a-walrus-site">Publishing a Walrus Site</a></h1>
<p>Now that everything is installed and configured, you should be able to start publishing
your first Walrus Site!</p>
<h2 id="select-the-source-material-for-the-site"><a class="header" href="#select-the-source-material-for-the-site">Select the source material for the site</a></h2>
<p>The <code>site-builder</code> works by uploading a directory of files produced by any web framework to Walrus
and adding the relevant metadata to Sui. This directory should have a file called <code>index.html</code> in
its root, which will be the entry point to the Walrus Site.</p>
<p>For the rest of the tutorial, we will use as an example the simple site contained in
<code>./examples/snake</code>.</p>
<h2 id="publish-the-site"><a class="header" href="#publish-the-site">Publish the site</a></h2>
<p>Since we have placed the <code>walrus</code> binary and configuration in their default locations, publishing
the <code>./examples/snake</code> site is as simple as calling the publishing command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./target/release/site-builder --config site-builder/assets/builder-example.yaml publish ./examples/snake
</code></pre>
<p>The output should look like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">Operations performed:
- created resource /Oi-Regular.ttf with blob ID 2YLU3Usb-WoJAgoNSZUNAFnmyo8cfV8hJYt2YdHL2Hs
- created resource /file.png with blob ID R584P82qm4Dn8LoQMlzkGZS9IAkU0lNZTVlruOsUyOs

New site object ID: 0x5ac988828a0c9842d91e6d5bdd9552ec9fcdddf11c56bf82dff6d5566685a31e

Browse the resulting site at: https://29gjzk8yjl1v7zm2etee1siyzaqfj9jaru5ufs6yyh1yqsgun2.walrus.site
</code></pre>
<p>This output tells you that, for each file in the folder, a new Walrus blob was created, and the
respective blob ID. Further, it prints the object ID of the Walrus Site object on Sui (so you can
have a look in the explorer and use it to set the SuiNS name) and, finally, the URL at which you
can browse the site.</p>
<p>Note here that we are passing the example config <code>assets/builder-example.yaml</code> as the config for the
site builder. The configuration file is necessary to ensure that the <code>site-builder</code> knows the
correct Sui package for the Walrus Sites logic.</p>
<p>More details on the configuration of the <code>site-builder</code> can be found under the <a href="walrus-sites/tutorial-config.html">advanced
configuration</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="update-the-site"><a class="header" href="#update-the-site">Update the site</a></h2>
<p>Let's say now you want to update the content of the site, for example by changing the title from
"eat all the blobs!" to "Glob all the Blobs!".</p>
<p>First, make this edit on in the <code>./examples/snake/index.html</code> file.</p>
<p>Then, you can update the existing site by running the <code>update</code> command, providing the directory
where to find the updated files (still <code>./example/snake</code>) and the object ID of the existing site
(<code>0x5ac988...</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./target/release/site-builder --config site-builder/assets/builder-example.yaml update ./examples/snake 0x5ac9888...
</code></pre>
<p>The output this time should be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">Operations performed:
  - deleted resource /index.html with blob ID SSzbpPfO2Tqk6xNyF1i-NG9I9CjUjuWnhUATVSs5nic

Browse the resulting site at: https://29gjzk8yjl1v7zm2etee1siyzaqfj9jaru5ufs6yyh1yqsgun2.walrus.site
</code></pre>
<p>Compared to the <code>publish</code> action, we can see that now the only actions performed were to delete the
old <code>index.html</code>, and update it with the newer one.</p>
<p>Browsing to the provided URL should reflect the change. You've updated the site!</p>

<p>The <code>site-builder</code> tool provides two additional utilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>convert</code> command converts an object ID in hex format to the equivalent Base36
format. This command is useful if you have the Sui object ID of a Walrus Site, and want to know
the subdomain where you can browse it.</li>
<li>The <code>sitemap</code> command shows the resources that compose the Walrus Site at the given object ID.</li>

<h1 id="bonus-set-a-suins-name"><a class="header" href="#bonus-set-a-suins-name">Bonus: Set a SuiNS name</a></h1>
<p>Browsing a URL like <code>https://29gjzk8yjl1v7zm2etee1siyzaqfj9jaru5ufs6yyh1yqsgun2.walrus.site</code> is not
particularly nice. Therefore, Walrus Sites allows to use SuiNS names (this is like DNS for Sui) to
assign a human-readable name to a Walrus Site. To do so, you simply have to get a SuiNS name you
like, and point it to the object ID of the Walrus Site (as provided by the <code>publish</code> or <code>update</code>
commands).</p>
<p>Let's do this step by step.</p>
<h2 id="get-a-suins-name"><a class="header" href="#get-a-suins-name">Get a SuiNS name</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Navigate to <a href="https://testnet.suins.io">https://testnet.suins.io</a> and buy a domain name with your Testnet wallet. For
example, <code>walrusgame</code> (this specific one is already taken, choose another you like).</p>

</div>
<a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="walrus-sites/tutorial-suins.html#admonition-note"></a>
</div>
<div>
<p>At the moment, you can only select names that are composed of letters <code>a-z</code> and numbers <code>0-9</code>, but
no special characters (e.g., <code>-</code>).</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="map-the-suins-name-to-the-walrus-site"><a class="header" href="#map-the-suins-name-to-the-walrus-site">Map the SuiNS name to the Walrus Site</a></h2>
<p>Now, you can set the SuiNS name to point to the address of your Walrus Site. To do so, go to the
<a href="https://testnet.suins.io/account/my-names">"names you own"</a> section of the SuiNS website, click on
the "three dots" menu icon above the name you want to map, and click "Link To Wallet Address". Paste
in the bar the object ID of the Walrus Site, check that it is correct, and click "Apply".</p>
<p>After approving the transaction, we can now browse <a href="https://walrusgame.walrus.site">https://walrusgame.walrus.site</a>!</p>
<h3 id="the-cli-way"><a class="header" href="#the-cli-way">The CLI way</a></h3>
<p>For completeness, we report here a manual way of setting the mapping between the SuiNS name and the
Walrus Site, using the CLI.</p>
<h4 id="get-the-suins-object-id"><a class="header" href="#get-the-suins-object-id">Get the SuiNS object ID</a></h4>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://testnet.suins.io/account/my-names">"names you own"</a> section of the SuiNS website,
click the three-dots menu on the top-right corner of the name, choose "View all info", and copy the
<code>ObjectID</code>. In our case, this is <code>0x6412...</code>.</p>
<h4 id="send-the-suins-registration-object-to-the-address-you-use-with-the-sui-cli"><a class="header" href="#send-the-suins-registration-object-to-the-address-you-use-with-the-sui-cli">Send the SuiNS registration object to the address you use with the Sui CLI</a></h4>
<p>The steps that follow require that the SuiNS registration object is owned by the address you are
using on the Sui CLI. Therefore, unless you use the same address in your browser wallet and the CLI,
we need to send this registration object from the address you use in your browser wallet to the
address of your Sui CLI.</p>
<p>To find the Sui CLI address, execute:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">sui client active-address
</code></pre>
<p>Then, from your browser wallet, select the "Assets" tab and look for the NFT of the SuiNS
registration, which should look as follows:</p>
<p><img src="walrus-sites/../assets/suins-asset.png" alt="the SuiNS registration inside the wallet" /></p>
<p>Click on it, scroll down to "Send NFT", and send it to the address discovered with the command
above. Now, your Sui CLI address owns the registration NFT, and you can proceed to the next step.</p>
<h4 id="use-the-cli-to-map-the-suins-name-to-the-walrus-site"><a class="header" href="#use-the-cli-to-map-the-suins-name-to-the-walrus-site">Use the CLI to map the SuiNS name to the Walrus Site</a></h4>
<p>This step associates the name <code>walrusgame</code> to the object ID of our Walrus Site. There are possibly
many ways to achieve this, one is to issue the following transaction using the Sui CLI to create
this mapping:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">SUINS_UTILS_PACKAGE=0x7954ae683314ec7e156acbf0c0fc964ce035fd7f456fe7576848226502cfde1b

<p>Configuring the <code>site-builder</code> tool is straightforward, but care is required to ensure that

<p>The <code>site-builder</code> tool requires a configuration file to know which package to use on Sui, which
wallet to use, the gas budget, and other operational details. Most of these are abstracted away
through sensible defaults, so you should not need to touch them. Yet, for completeness, we provide
here the details for all the configuration options.</p>
<h2 id="minimal-configuration"><a class="header" href="#minimal-configuration">Minimal configuration</a></h2>
<p>The config file is expected to be in <code>./builder.yaml</code>, and it is possible to point elsewhere with
the <code>--config</code> flag. For your first run, it should be sufficient to call the <code>site-builder</code> with
<code>--config site-builder/assets/builder-example.yaml</code>, which is already configured appropriately.</p>
<p>If, for any reason, you didn't add <code>walrus</code> to <code>$PATH</code>, make sure to configure a pointer to the
binary, see below.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-configuration"><a class="header" href="#advanced-configuration">Advanced configuration</a></h2>
<p>If you want to have more control over the behavior of the site builder, you can customize the
following variables in the config file:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>package</code>: the object ID of the Walrus Sites package on Sui. This must always be specified in the
config, and is already appropriately configured in <code>assets/example-config.yaml</code>.</li>
<li><code>portal</code>: the name of the Portal through which the site will be viewed; this only affects the
output of the CLI, and nothing else (default: <code>walrus.site</code>).
All Walrus Sites are accessible through any Portal independent of this setting.</li>
<li><code>general</code>: these are general options that can be configured both through the CLI and the config:
<ul>
<li><code>rpc_url</code>: The URL of the Sui RPC node to use. If not set, the <code>site-builder</code> will infer it from
the wallet.</li>
<li><code>wallet</code>: Pointer to the Sui wallet to be used. By default, it uses the system-wide wallet (the
one from <code>sui client addresses</code>).</li>
<li><code>walrus_binary</code>: Pointer to the <code>walrus</code> binary. By default, this is expected to be run from
<code>$PATH</code>.</li>
<li><code>walrus_config</code>: The configuration for the <code>walrus</code> client binary, see the <a href="walrus-sites/../usage/setup.html">relevant
chapter</a>.</li>
<li><code>gas_budget</code>: The maximum amount of gas to be spent for transactions (default: 500M MIST).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="technical-overview"><a class="header" href="#technical-overview">Technical Overview</a></h1>
<p>In the following sections, we delve deeper in the technical specification of Walrus Sites.</p>
<h2 id="high-level-picture"><a class="header" href="#high-level-picture">High-level picture</a></h2>
<p>Walrus Sites are enabled by Sui and Walrus. The resources of the Walrus Site (<code>html</code>, <code>css</code>, <code>js</code>,
images, etc.) are stored on Walrus, while the main entry point to it is an object stored on Sui,
which contains the metadata for the site and point to the Walrus blob IDs.</p>
<h3 id="the-walrus-sites-objects-on-sui"><a class="header" href="#the-walrus-sites-objects-on-sui">The Walrus Sites objects on Sui</a></h3>
<p>A Walrus <code>Site</code> is represented on Sui as a very simple object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-move">struct Site has key, store {
    id: UID,
    name: String,
}
</code></pre>
<p>The resources associated with this site are then added to this object as <a href="https://docs.sui.io/concepts/dynamic-fields/">dynamic
fields</a> of type <code>Resource</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-move">struct Resource has store, drop {
    path: String,
    content_type: String,
    content_encoding: String,
    // The walrus blob id containing the bytes for this resource
    blob_id: u256,
}
</code></pre>
<p>Each resource contains</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>path</code> of the resource, for example <code>/index.html</code> (all the paths are always represented as
starting from root <code>/</code>);</li>
<li>the <code>content_type</code> of the resource, for example <code>text/html</code>;</li>
<li>the <code>content_encoding</code> of the resource (at the moment the only available value is <code>plaintext</code>);
and</li>
<li>the <code>blob_id</code>, which is the Walrus blob ID where the resource can be found.</li>
</ul>
<p>These <code>Resource</code> dynamic fields are keyed with a struct of type <code>ResourcePath</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-move">struct ResourcePath has copy, store, drop {
    path: String,
}
</code></pre>
<p>This struct just holds the string of the path (<code>/index.html</code>); having a separate type ensures that
we will not have namespace collisions with other dynamic fields, possibly added by other packages.</p>
<p>To see this in action, look at <a href="https://suiscan.xyz/testnet/object/0x049b6d3f34789904efcc20254400b7dca5548ee35cd7b5b145a211f85b2532fa">a Walrus Site in the
explorer</a>,
and check its dynamic fields.</p>
<h3 id="the-site-rendering-path"><a class="header" href="#the-site-rendering-path">The site rendering path</a></h3>
<p>Given the Sui object ID of a Walrus Site, it is easy to look up the resources that compose it
by looking at the dynamic fields, and then fetch these resources from Walrus using the blob ID
contained in the <code>Resource</code> struct.</p>
<p>The only outstanding question is, therefore, how to perform these lookups on the client. A few
approaches are possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a server that accepts requests for a Sui object ID and possibly a path, and performs this
resolution on behalf of the client, serving back the resource as a standard HTML Response.</li>
<li>Using a custom application on the client that has both a web browser and knowledge of how Walrus
Sites work, and can locally perform this resolution.</li>
<li>A hybrid approach based on service workers, where a service worker that is able to perform the
resolution is installed in the browser from a Portal.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these approaches are viable (the first has been used for similar applications in IPFS
gateways, for example), and have trade-offs. As an initial step, we have chosen to use the
service-worker based approach, as it is light weight and ensures that the Portal does not have to
process all the traffic from clients. This approach is described in the following.</p>
<h3 id="browsing-and-domain-isolation"><a class="header" href="#browsing-and-domain-isolation">Browsing and domain isolation</a></h3>
<p>We must ensure that, when browsing multiple sites through a Portal, for example the one hosted at
<a href="https://walrus.site">https://walrus.site</a>, these sites are isolated. Isolation is necessary for security, and to ensure
that the wallet connection in the browser works as expected.</p>
<p>To do so, we give each Walrus Site a specific <em>subdomain</em> of the Portal's domain. For example, the
Flatland mint dApp is hosted at <a href="https://flatland.walrus.site">https://flatland.walrus.site</a>, where the subdomain <code>flatland</code> is
uniquely associated to the object ID of the Walrus Site through SuiNS.</p>
<p>Walrus Sites also work without SuiNS: a site can <em>always</em> be browsed by using as subdomain the
Base36 encoding of the Sui object ID of the site. For the Flatland dApp, this URL is:
<a href="https://44terjw9uzwbmtful0387e2bx3k3ro64s0it82hw9x9sz4ttm.walrus.site">https://44terjw9uzwbmtful0387e2bx3k3ro64s0it82hw9x9sz4ttm.walrus.site</a>.</p>
<p>Base36 was chosen for two reasons, forced by the subdomain standards:</p>
<ol>
<li>A subdomain can have at most 63 characters, while a Hex-encoded Sui object ID requires 64.</li>
<li>A subdomain is case <em>insensitive</em>, ruling out other popular encodings, e.g., Base64 or Base58.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-end-to-end-resolution-of-a-walrus-site"><a class="header" href="#the-end-to-end-resolution-of-a-walrus-site">The end-to-end resolution of a Walrus Site</a></h2>
<p>We now show in greater detail how a Walrus Site is rendered in a client's browser with the service
worker approach. The steps below all reference the following figure:</p>
<p><img src="walrus-sites/../assets/walrus-site-diagram.svg" alt="Walrus Site resolution" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Site publishing</strong> (step 0): The site developer publishes the Walrus Site using the
<a href="walrus-sites/overview.html#the-site-builder"><code>site-builder</code></a>, or making use of a publisher. Assume the developer uses the
SuiNS name <code>dapp.sui</code> to point to the object ID of the created Walrus Site.</li>
<li><strong>Browsing starts</strong> (step 1): A client browses <code>dapp.walrus.site/index.html</code> in their browser.</li>
<li><strong>Service worker installation</strong> (steps 2-6): The browser connects to the Portal hosted at
<code>walrus.site</code>, which responds with a page that installs the service worker for
<code>dapp.walrus.site</code>. The page is refreshed to activate the service worker.</li>
<li><strong>Site resolution</strong> (steps 7-10): The service worker, which is now installed, interprets its
<em>origin</em> <code>dapp.walrus.site</code>, and makes a SuiNS resolution for <code>dapp.sui</code>, obtaining the related
object ID. Using the object ID, it then fetches the dynamic fields of the object (also checking
<a href="walrus-sites/./portal.html">redirects</a>). From the dynamic fields, it selects the one for <code>/index.html</code>, and
extracts its Walrus blob ID and content type.</li>
<li><strong>Blob fetch</strong> (steps 11-14): Given the blob ID, the service worker queries a Walrus aggregator
for the blob.</li>
<li><strong>Returning the response</strong> (steps 15-16): Now that the service worker has the bytes for
<code>/index.html</code>, and its <code>content_type</code>, it can craft a response that is then rendered by the
browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>These steps are executed for all resources the browser may query thereafter (for example, if
<code>/index.html</code> points to <code>assets/cat.png</code>).</p>
<h2 id="the-site-builder"><a class="header" href="#the-site-builder">The site builder</a></h2>
<p>To facilitate the creation of Walrus Sites, we provide the "site builder" tool. The site builder
takes care of creating Walrus Sites object on Sui, with the correct structure, and stores the site
resources to Walrus. Refer to the <a href="walrus-sites/./tutorial.html">tutorial</a> for setup and usage instructions.</p>

<h1 id="linking-from-and-to-walrus-sites"><a class="header" href="#linking-from-and-to-walrus-sites">Linking from and to Walrus Sites</a></h1>
<p>Links in Walrus Sites work <em>almost</em> as you would expect in a regular website. We specify here a few
of the details.</p>
<h2 id="linking-to-resources-within-the-same-site"><a class="header" href="#linking-to-resources-within-the-same-site">Linking to resources within the same site</a></h2>
<p>Relative and absolute links (<code>href="/path/to/resource.html"</code>) work as usual.</p>
<h2 id="linking-to-resources-on-the-web"><a class="header" href="#linking-to-resources-on-the-web">Linking to resources on the web</a></h2>
<p>Linking to a resource on the web (<code>href="https://some.cdn.example.com/stylesheet.css"</code>) also works
as usual.</p>
<h2 id="linking-to-resources-in-other-walrus-sites"><a class="header" href="#linking-to-resources-in-other-walrus-sites">Linking to resources in other Walrus Sites</a></h2>
<p>Here is the part that is a bit different. Assume there is some image that you can browse at
<code>https://gallery.walrus.site/walrus_arctic.webp</code>, and you want to link it from your own Walrus Site.</p>
<p>Recall that, however, <code>https://walrus.site</code> is just one of the possibly many Portals. I.e., the same
resource is browsable from a local Portal (<code>http://gallery.localhost:8080/walrus_arctic.webp</code>), or
from any other Portal (e.g., <code>https://gallery.myotherportal.com/walrus_arctic.webp</code>). Therefore, how
can you link the resource in a <em>Portal independent way</em>? This is important for interoperability,
availability, and respecting the user's choice of Portal.</p>
<h3 id="the-solution-walrus-sites-links"><a class="header" href="#the-solution-walrus-sites-links">The solution: Walrus Sites links</a></h3>
<p>We solve this problem by having the Portals interpret special links that are normally invalid on
the web and redirect to the corresponding Walrus Sites resource in the Portal itself.</p>
<p>Consider the example above, where the resource <code>/walrus_arctic.webp</code> is browsed from the Walrus Site
with SuiNS name <code>gallery</code>, which points to the object ID <code>abcd123…</code> (in Base36 encoding). Then,
the Portal-independent link is: <code>https://gallery.suiobj/walrus_arctic.webp</code>. To fix the object ID
instead of the SuiNS name, you can use <code>https://abcd123….suiobj/walrus_arctic.webp</code>.</p>
<p>Another possibility is to directly point to the Walrus <em>blob ID</em> of the resource, and have the
browser "sniff" the content type. This works for images, for example, but not for script or
stylesheets. For example to point to the blob ID (e.g., containing an image) <code>qwer5678…</code>, use the
URL <code>https://blobid.walrus/qwer5678…</code>.</p>
<p>With such a link, the Portal will extract the blob ID and redirect the request to the aggregator it
is using to fetch blobs.</p>

<h1 id="redirecting-objects-to-walrus-sites"><a class="header" href="#redirecting-objects-to-walrus-sites">Redirecting objects to Walrus Sites</a></h1>
<p>We have seen in the <a href="walrus-sites/./overview.html">overview</a> how a Walrus Site object on Sui looks like. We will
discuss now how you can create ensure that a <em>set of arbitrary objects</em> can all be tied to a
specific, and possibly unique, Walrus Site.</p>
<h2 id="the-goal"><a class="header" href="#the-goal">The goal</a></h2>
<p>Consider a collection of NFTs, such as the one published by <a href="https://flatland.walrus.site">https://flatland.walrus.site</a>. As we
show there, each minted NFT has its own Walrus Site, which can be personalized based on the contents
(e.g., the color) of the NFT itself. How can we achieve this?</p>
<h2 id="redirect-links"><a class="header" href="#redirect-links">Redirect links</a></h2>
<p>The solution is simple: We add a "redirect" in the NFT's
<a href="https://docs.sui.io/standards/display#sui-utility-objects"><code>Display</code></a> property. Each time an NFT's
object ID is browsed through a Portal, the Portal will check the <code>Display</code> of the NFT and, if it
encounters the <code>walrus site address</code> key, it will go fetch the Walrus Site that is at the
corresponding object ID.</p>
<h3 id="redirects-in-move"><a class="header" href="#redirects-in-move">Redirects in Move</a></h3>
<p>Practically speaking, when creating the <code>Display</code> of the NFT, you can include the key-value pair
that points to the Walrus Site that is to be used.</p>
<pre><code class="language-move">...
const VISUALIZATION_SITE: address = @0x901fb0...;
display.add(b"walrus site address".to_string(), VISUALIZATION_SITE.to_string());
...
</code></pre>
<h3 id="how-to-personalize-based-on-the-nft"><a class="header" href="#how-to-personalize-based-on-the-nft">How to personalize based on the NFT?</a></h3>
<p>The code above will only open the specified Walrus Site when browsing the object ID of the NFT. How
do we ensure that the properties of the NFT can be used to personalize the site?</p>
<p>This needs to be done in the <code>VISUALIZATION_SITE</code>: Since the subdomain is still pointing to the
NFT's object ID, the Walrus Site that is loaded can check its <code>origin</code> in JavaScript, and use the
subdomain to determine the NFT, fetch it from chain, and use its internal fields to modify the
displayed site.</p>

<h1 id="the-walrus-sites-portal"><a class="header" href="#the-walrus-sites-portal">The Walrus Sites Portal</a></h1>
<p>We use the term "Portal" to indicate any technology that is used to access an browse Walrus Sites.
As mentioned in the <a href="walrus-sites/./overview.html#the-site-rendering-path">overview</a>, we foresee three kinds of
Portals:</p>
<ol>
<li>server-side Portals;</li>
<li>custom local apps; and</li>
<li>service-worker based Portals in the browser.</li>
</ol>
<p>Currently, only the service-worker based Portal is available.</p>
<h2 id="running-the-portal-locally"><a class="header" href="#running-the-portal-locally">Running the Portal locally</a></h2>
<p>You can run a service-worker Portal locally if you want to browse Walrus Sites without accessing
external Portals or for development purposes.</p>
<p>This requires having the <a href="https://pnpm.io/"><code>pnpm</code></a> tool installed. To start, clone the
<code>walrus-sites</code> repo and enter the <code>portal</code> directory. Here, run</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">pnpm install
</code></pre>
<p>to install the dependencies, and</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">pnpm serve
</code></pre>
<p>to serve the Portal. Typically, you will find it served at <code>localhost:8080</code> (but check the output of
the serve command).</p>
<h2 id="configuring-the-portal"><a class="header" href="#configuring-the-portal">Configuring the Portal</a></h2>
<p>The most important configuration parameters for the Portal are in <code>constants.ts</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>NETWORK</code>: The Sui network to be used for fetching the Walrus Sites objects. Currently, we
use Sui <code>testnet</code>.</li>
<li><code>AGGREGATOR</code>: The URL of the <a href="walrus-sites/../usage/web-api.html">aggregator</a> from which the service worker will

<h1 id="known-restrictions"><a class="header" href="#known-restrictions">Known restrictions</a></h1>
<p>Walrus Sites can be used to deploy almost any form of traditional static web2 website build for
modern browsers. There are, however, a number of restrictions that a developer should keep in mind
when creating or porting a website to Walrus Sites.</p>
<h2 id="no-secret-values"><a class="header" href="#no-secret-values">No secret values</a></h2>
<p>Walrus Sites are fully publicly accessible, as the metadata is stored on Sui, and the site content
is stored on Walrus. Therefore, developers <em>must not</em> store secret values within the sites.</p>
<p>We emphasize again that any such backend-specific operations (storing secret values, authentication,
etc.) are achievable by leveraging the integration with the Sui blockchain and a Sui-compatible
wallet.</p>
<h2 id="there-is-a-maximum-redirect-depth"><a class="header" href="#there-is-a-maximum-redirect-depth">There is a maximum redirect depth</a></h2>
<p>The number of consecutive redirects a Walrus Site can perform is capped by the
Portal (see <a href="walrus-sites/./portal.html">Portal configuration</a>). This measure ensures that loading a Walrus Site
does not result in an infinite loading loop.</p>
<p>Different Portals can set this limit as they desire. The limit for the Portal hosted at
<a href="https://walrus.site">https://walrus.site</a> has a maximum redirect depth of 3.</p>
<h2 id="service-workers-are-not-available"><a class="header" href="#service-workers-are-not-available">Service workers are not available</a></h2>
<p>Walrus Sites leverage service workers in the clients' browsers to perform essential operations:</p>
<ol>
<li>reading the site metadata from Sui;</li>
<li>fetching the page content from Walrus; and</li>
<li>serving the content to the browser.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, a site deployed on Walrus Sites cannot use service workers itself. Installing a service
worker from within a Walrus Site will result in a dysfunctional site and a poor experience for the
user.</p>

<p>Service workers cannot be loaded inside an in-app browser on iOS, because of a limitation of the
WebKit engine. As a consequence, Walrus Sites cannot be used within Sui-compatible wallet apps on
iOS. Therefore, Sui wallets cannot currently be used on a Walrus Site on iOS. Note, however, that
<em>browsing</em> a Walrus Site is still possible on iOS through any browser. Only the connection to the
wallet is impacted.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-disclose-your-information"><a class="header" href="#how-we-disclose-your-information">HOW WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION</a></h2>
<p>We disclose your information to third parties for a variety of business
purposes, including to provide our Services, to protect us or others, or
in the event of a major business transaction such as a merger, sale, or
asset transfer, as described below.</p>
<p>A.  <strong>Disclosures to Provide our Services</strong></p>
<p>The categories of third parties with whom we may share your information
are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Notice Regarding Use of Blockchain.</strong> Transactions on the Services
will be conducted via Blockchain. Information about your transfers
will be provided to a Blockchain and may be accessible to third
parties due to the public nature of the Blockchain. Because entries
to a Blockchain are, by their nature, public, and because it may be
possible for someone to identify you through your pseudonymous,
public wallet address using external sources of information, any
transaction you enter onto the Blockchain could possibly be used to
identify you, or information about you.</li>
<li><strong>Other Users of the Services and Parties You Transact With.</strong> Some
of your personal information may be visible to other users of the
Services (e.g., information featured on generally accessible parts
of your profile; usernames of other Mysten Labs Services users). In
addition, to complete transfers via the Services, we will need to
share some of your personal information with the party that you are
transacting with.</li>
<li><strong>Third Party Websites and Applications.</strong> You may choose to share
personal information or interact with third-party websites and/or
third-party applications, including, but not limited to, third-party
electronic wallet extensions. Once your personal information has
been shared with a third-party website or a third-party application,
it will also be subject to such third party's privacy policy. We
encourage you to closely read each third-party website or
third-party application privacy policy before sharing your personal
information or otherwise interacting with them. Please note that we
do not control, and we are not responsible for the third-party
website's or the third-party application's processing of your
personal information.</li>

our third-party service providers who use that information to help
us provide our Services. This includes service providers that
provide us with IT support, hosting, customer service, and related

business partners to provide you with a product or service you have
requested. We may also share your personal information to business
partners with whom we jointly offer products or services.</li>

of our corporate family.</li>
<li><strong>Other Users/Website Visitors</strong>. As described above in "<a href="walrus-sites/privacy.html#personal-information-we-collect">Personal

Services allow you to share your profile and/or User Content with
other users or publicly, including to those who do not use our
Services.</li>
<li><strong>Advertising Partners</strong>. We may share your personal information
with third-party advertising partners. These third-party advertising
partners may set Technologies and other tracking tools on our
Services to collect information regarding your activities and your
device (e.g., your IP address, cookie identifiers, page(s) visited,
location, time of day). These advertising partners may use this
information (and similar information collected from other services)
for purposes of delivering personalized advertisements to you when
you visit digital properties within their networks. This practice is
commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising" or
"personalized advertising."</li>

</ul>
<p>B.  <strong>Disclosures to Protect Us or Others</strong></p>
<p>We may access, preserve, and disclose any information we store
associated with you to external parties if we, in good faith, believe
doing so is required or appropriate to: comply with law enforcement or
national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or
subpoena; protect your, our, or others' rights, property, or safety;
enforce our policies or contracts; collect amounts owed to us; or assist
with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal
activity.</p>
<p>C.  <strong>Disclosure in the Event of Merger, Sale, or Other Asset
Transfers</strong></p>
<p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence,

transition of service to another provider, your information may be sold
or transferred as part of such a transaction, as permitted by law and/or
contract.</p>

AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND MYSTEN LABS THROUGH
BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION XIV “DISPUTE
RESOLUTION” BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION.</p>
<h2 id="i-privacy-policy"><a class="header" href="#i-privacy-policy">I. Privacy Policy</a></h2>
<p>Please review our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Services, for information on
how we collect, use and share your information. By using the Services you agree to be bound by our

<h2 id="iii-walrus-sites"><a class="header" href="#iii-walrus-sites">III. Walrus Sites</a></h2>
<p>The Services allow you access website resources (“<strong>Stored Objects</strong>”) that are stored in the Walrus

Services. Stored Objects are developed by people over whom Mysten Labs exercises no control. The
Services may provide you with access to Stored Objects that some people find objectionable,
inappropriate, or offensive. We assume no responsibility for the content of Stored Objects accessed
through the Services.</p>

<h2 id="xiii-governing-law-and-forum-choice"><a class="header" href="#xiii-governing-law-and-forum-choice">XIII. Governing Law and Forum Choice.</a></h2>
<p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal
arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws
provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section XVII “Dispute Resolution,” the
exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Mysten Labs are not required to
arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the County of Santa Clara, and you and
Mysten Labs each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</p>
<h2 id="xiv-dispute-resolution"><a class="header" href="#xiv-dispute-resolution">XIV. Dispute Resolution</a></h2>
<ol>
<li><u>Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes</u>. We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy
arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation
or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be resolved solely
by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or
proceeding. You and Mysten Labs agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the
interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Mysten Labs are each waiving the
right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall
survive termination of these Terms.</li>
<li><u>Exceptions</u>. As limited exceptions to Section XVII(A) above: (i) we both may seek to
resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek
injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or
misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.</li>
<li><u>Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules</u>. The arbitration will be conducted by the
American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”)
then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or
by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand
for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA
provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a href="http://www.adr.org"><u>www.adr.org</u></a>. Any
arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both
agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive
authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and
scope of this arbitration agreement.</li>
<li><u>Arbitration Costs</u>. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be
governed by the AAA Rules, and we won’t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we
are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in
arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from
you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and
expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.</li>
<li><u>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief</u>. Except as provided in Section XIV(B) above, the
arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either
party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking
relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual
claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is,
injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that
threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be
litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree
that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of
the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.</li>
<li><u>Class Action Waiver</u>. YOU AND MYSTEN LABS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved through
arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may
not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific
provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall
be null and void.</li>
<li><u>Severability</u>. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section XVII(F) of these
Terms (“<strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides
that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will
still apply.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="xv-general-terms"><a class="header" href="#xv-general-terms">XV. General Terms</a></h2>
<ol>
<li><u>Reservation of Rights</u>. Mysten Labs and its licensors exclusively own all right, title and
interest in and to the Services, including all associated intellectual property rights. You
acknowledge that the Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United
States and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark,
service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Services.</li>
<li><u>Entire Agreement</u>. These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and
agreement between Mysten Labs and you regarding the Services, and these Terms supersede and
replace all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Mysten Labs and you
regarding the Services. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an
arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum
extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and
effect. Except where provided by applicable law in your jurisdiction, you may not assign or
transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Mysten Labs’ prior written
consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms absent our consent or your statutory
right, without such consent, will be null. Mysten Labs may freely assign or transfer these Terms
without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of
the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</li>
<li><u>Notices</u>. Any notices or other communications provided by Mysten Labs under these Terms
will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by email, the
date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</li>
<li><u>Waiver of Rights</u>. Mysten Labs’ failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms
will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or
provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of
Mysten Labs. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of
its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms
or otherwise.</li>

</ul>
<p>We may, at our discretion, introduce new or change existing eligibility criteria or conditions we
deem appropriate. Devnet may operate in certain phases, and your participation in any one phase of

<h2 id="duration"><a class="header" href="#duration">Duration</a></h2>
<p>Devnet will commence on the date we prescribe and continue until terminated at our discretion. We

presence, amounts, or any other conditions applicable to data you have stored within Devnet, without
any liability to you or other Devnet users.</p>
