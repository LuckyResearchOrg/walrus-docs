<p>Welcome to the developer documentation for Walrus, a decentralized storage and availability protocol
designed specifically for large binary files, or "blobs". Walrus focuses on providing a robust
solution for storing unstructured content on decentralized storage nodes while ensuring high
availability and reliability even in the presence of Byzantine faults.</p>
<h2 id="features"><a class="header" href="#features">Features</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage and retrieval</strong>: Walrus supports storage operations to write and read blobs. It also
allows anyone to prove that a blob has been stored and is available for retrieval at a later
time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost efficiency</strong>: By utilizing advanced error correction coding, Walrus maintains storage
costs at approximately five times the size of the stored blobs and encoded parts of each blob
are stored on each storage node. This is significantly more cost-effective compared to
traditional full replication methods and much more robust against failures compared to
protocols that only store each blob on a subset of storage nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integration with Sui blockchain</strong>: Walrus leverages the <a href="https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui">Sui</a>
for coordination, attesting availability and payments. Storage space can be owned as a resource on
Sui, split, merged, and transferred. Blob storage is represented using storage objects on Sui, and
smart contracts can check whether a blob is available and for how long.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexible access</strong>: Users can interact with Walrus through a command-line interface (CLI),
software development kits (SDKs), and web2 HTTP technologies. Walrus is designed to work well
with traditional caches and content distribution networks (CDNs), while ensuring all operations
can also be run using local tools to maximize decentralization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="architecture-and-operations"><a class="header" href="#architecture-and-operations">Architecture and operations</a></h2>
<p>Walrus's architecture ensures that content remains accessible and retrievable even when many
storage nodes are unavailable or malicious. Under the hood it uses modern error correction
techniques based on fast linear fountain codes, augmented to ensure resilience against Byzantine
faults, and a dynamically changing set of storage nodes. The core of Walrus remains simple, and
storage node management and blob certification leverages Sui smart contracts.</p>
<p>This documentation is split into several parts. The first part provides an overview of the
objectives, security properties, and architecture of the Walrus system. The second part contains
concrete documentation on the usage of Walrus. At the end, we provide a <a href="./glossary.html">glossary</a>,
which defines key terms used throughout the project.</p>
<p>Walrus is architected to provide a reliable and cost-effective solution for large-scale blob
storage, making it an ideal choice for applications requiring decentralized, affordable, durable,
and accessible data storage.</p>
<h2 id="sources"><a class="header" href="#sources">Sources</a></h2>
<p>This documentation is built using <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/">mdBook</a> from source files in
<a href="https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-docs/">github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-docs/</a>. Please report or

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="objectives-and-use-cases"><a class="header" href="#objectives-and-use-cases">Objectives and use-cases</a></h1>
<p>Walrus supports operations to store and retrieve blobs, and to prove and verify their availability.
It ensures content survives storage nodes suffering Byzantine faults and remains available and
retrievable. It provides APIs to access the stored content over a CLI, SDKs and over web2 HTTP
technologies, and supports contend delivery infrastructures like caches and content distribution
networks (CDNs).</p>
<p>Under the hood, storage cost is a small fixed multiple of the size of blobs (around 5x) thanks to
advanced error correction coding, in contrast to the full replication of data traditional to
blockchains such as &gt;100x for data stored in Sui objects. As a result much bigger resources, up to
several GiB, may be stored on Walrus at substantially lower cost compared to Sui or other
blockchains. Since encoded blobs are stored on all storage nodes Walrus also provides superior
robustness compared with designs with a small amount of replicas storing the full blob.</p>
<p>Walrus uses the Sui chain for coordination and payments. Available storage is represented as Sui
objects that can be acquired, owned, split, merged and transferred. Storage space can be tied to
a stored blob for a period of time. And the resulting Sui object may be used to prove
availability on chain in smart contracts, or off chain using light clients.</p>
<p>In the <a href="./overview.html">next chapter</a> we discuss in details the above operations relating to storage,
retrieval and availability.</p>
<p>In the future, we plan to include in Walrus some minimal governance to allow storage nodes to
change between storage epochs. Walrus is also compatible with periodic payments for continued
storage. We also plan to implement storage attestation based on challenges to get confidence that
that blobs are stored or at least available. Walrus also allows light-nodes that store small parts
of blobs to get rewards for proving availability and assisting recovery. We will cover these
topics in later documents. We also provide details of the encoding scheme in a separate document.</p>
<h2 id="non-objectives"><a class="header" href="#non-objectives">Non-objectives</a></h2>
<p>There are a few things that Walrus explicitly is not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walrus does not reimplement a CDN that might be geo-replicated or have less than tens of
milliseconds of latency. Instead, it ensures that traditional CDNs are usable and compatible with
Walrus caches.</li>
<li>Walrus does not re-implement a full smart contracts platform with consensus or execution. It
relies on Sui smart contracts when necessary, to manage Walrus resources and processes including
payments, storage epochs etc.</li>
<li>Walrus supports storage of any blob including encrypted blobs, however Walrus itself is not the
distributed key management infrastructure that manages and distributed encryption or decryption
keys to support a full private storage eco-system. It can however provide the storage layer of for
such infrastructures.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="use-cases"><a class="header" href="#use-cases">Use-cases</a></h2>
<p>App builders may use Walrus in conjunction with Sui to build experiences that require large
amounts of  data to be stored in a decentralized manner and possibly certified as available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storage of media for NFT or dapps</strong>: Walrus can directly store and serve media such as images,
sounds, sprites, videos, other game assets, etc. This is publicly available media that can be
accessed using HTTP requests at caches to create multimedia dapps.</li>
<li><strong>AI related use cases</strong>: Walrus can store clean data sets of training data, datasets with a
known and verified provenance, models weights, and proofs of correct training for AI models.
Or it may be used to store and ensure the availability of an AI model output.</li>
<li><strong>Storage of long term archival of blockchain history</strong>: Walrus can be used as a lower cost
decentralized store to store blockchain history. For Sui this can include sequences of
checkpoints with all associated transaction and effects content. As well as historic snapshots
of the blockchain state, code or binaries.</li>
<li><strong>Support availability for L2s</strong>: Walrus allows parties to certify the availability of blobs, as
required by L2s that need data to be stored and be attested as available to all. This may also
include availability of extra audit data such as validity proofs, zero knowledge proofs of
correct execution or large fraud proofs.</li>
<li><strong>Support a full decentralized web experience</strong>: Walrus can host full decentralized web
experiences including all resources (such as js, css, html, media). These can provide content but
also host the UX of dapps to build dapps with fully decentralized front end and back ends on
chain. It brings the full "web" back in "web3".</li>
<li><strong>Support subscription models for media</strong>: Creators can store encrypted media on Walrus and only
provide access via decryption keys to parties that have paid a subscription fee or have paid for
contents. (Note that Walrus provides the storage, encryption and decryption needs to happen off
Walrus).</li>
</ul>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="walrus-assurance-and-security-properties"><a class="header" href="#walrus-assurance-and-security-properties">Walrus assurance and security properties</a></h1>
<p>The properties below hold true subject to the assumption that for all storage epochs 2/3 of shards
are operated by storage nodes that faithfully and correctly follow the Walrus protocol.</p>
<p>Each blob is encoded using error correction into slivers and a <strong>blob ID</strong> is cryptographically
derived. For a given blob ID there is a <strong>point of availability</strong> (PoA) and an <strong>availability
period</strong>, observable through an event on the Sui chain. The following properties relate to the PoA:</p>
<ul>
<li>After the PoA, for a blob ID, any correct user that performs a read within the availability
period will eventually terminate and get a value V which is either blob contents F or None.</li>
<li>After PoA if two correct users perform a read and get V and V’ then V = V’.</li>
<li>A correct user with an appropriate storage resource can always perform store for a blob F with a
blob ID and advance the protocol until the PoA.</li>
<li>A read after PoA for a blob F stored by a correct user, will result in F.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some assurance properties ensure the correct internal processes of Walrus storage nodes.
For the purposes of defining these, an <strong>inconsistency proof</strong> proves that a blob ID was
stored by an incorrect user (and was incorrectly encoded).</p>
<ul>
<li>After PoA and for a blob ID stored by a correct user, a storage node is always able to recover
the correct sliver for its shards for this blob ID.</li>
<li>After PoA if a correct storage node cannot recover a sliver, it can produce an inconsistency proof
for the blob ID.</li>
<li>If a blob ID is stored by a correct user, an inconsistently proof cannot be derived for it.</li>
<li>A read by a correct user for a blob ID for which an inconsistency proof may exist returns None.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that there is no delete operation and a blob ID past PoA will be available for the full
availability period.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb: before PoA it is the responsibility of a client to ensure the availability of
a blob and its upload to Walrus. After PoA it is the responsibility of Walrus as a system to
maintain the availability of the blob ID as part of its operation for the full availability period
remaining. Emission of the event corresponding to the PoA for a blob ID attests its
availability.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="basic-architecture-and-security-assumptions"><a class="header" href="#basic-architecture-and-security-assumptions">Basic architecture and security assumptions</a></h1>
<p>The key actors in the Walrus architecture are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Users</strong> through <strong>clients</strong> want to store and read <strong>blobs</strong>. They are ready to pay for service
when it comes to writes, and when it comes to non-best-effort reads. Users also want to prove
the <strong>availability</strong> of a blob to third parties without the cost of sending or receiving the full
blob. Users may be malicious in various ways: they may wish to not pay for services, prove the
availability of an unavailable blobs, or modify / delete blobs without authorization, try to
exhaust resources of storage nodes, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Storage nodes</strong> hold one or many <strong>shards</strong> within a <strong>storage epoch</strong>. Each blob is erasure
encoded in many <strong>slivers</strong> and slivers from each stored blob become part of all shards. A shard
at any storage epoch is associated with a <strong>storage node</strong> that actually stores all slivers of
the shard, and is ready to serve them. The assignment of storage nodes to shards within
<strong>storage epochs</strong> is controlled by a Sui smart contract and we assume that more than 2/3 of the
shards are managed by correct storage nodes within each storage epoch. This means that we must
tolerate up to 1/3 Byzantine storage nodes within each storage epoch and across storage epochs.</li>
<li>All clients and storage nodes operate a <strong>blockchain</strong> client (specifically on Sui), and mediate
payments, resources (space), mapping of shards to storage nodes, and metadata through blockchain
smart contracts. Users interact with the blockchain to get storage resources and certify stored
blobs, and storage nodes listen to the blockchain events to coordinate their operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Walrus supports any additional number of optional infrastructure actors that can operate in a
permissionless way:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Caches</strong> are <strong>clients</strong> that store one or more full blobs and make them available to users
over traditional web2 (HTTP, etc) technologies. They are optional in that end-users may also
operate a local cache, and perform Walrus reads over web2 technologies locally. However, cache
infrastructures may also act as CDNs, share the cost of blob reconstruction over many requests,
have better connectivity, etc. A client can always verify that reads from such infrastructures
are correct.</li>
<li><strong>Publishers</strong> are <strong>clients</strong> that help end-users store a blob using web2 technologies, and
using less bandwidth and custom logic. They in effect receive the blob to be published. over
traditional web2 protocols (e.g., HTTP), and perform the Walrus store protocol on their behalf,
including the encoding, distribution of slivers to shards, creation of certificate of certificate,
and other on-chain actions. They are optional in that a user may directly interact with both Sui
and storage nodes to store blobs directly. An end user can always verify that a publisher
performed their duties correctly by attesting availability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Caches, publishers, and end-users are not considered trusted components of the system, and they may
deviate from the protocol arbitrarily. However, some of the security properties of Walrus only hold
for honest end-users that use honest intermediaries (caches and publishers). We provide means for
end-users to audit the correct operation of both caches and publishers.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="encoding-overheads-and-verification"><a class="header" href="#encoding-overheads-and-verification">Encoding, overheads, and verification</a></h1>
<p>We summarize here the basic encoding and cryptographic techniques used in Walrus.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storage nodes</strong> hold one or many <strong>shards</strong> in a storage epoch, out of a larger total (say 1000)
and each shard contains one blob <strong>sliver</strong> for each blob past PoA. Each shard is assigned to a
storage node in a storage epoch.</li>
<li>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_codes">erasure code</a> <strong>encode algorithm</strong> takes a blob,
and encodes it as $K$ symbols, such that any fraction $p$ of symbols can be used to reconstruct
the blob. Each blob sliver contains a fixed number of such symbols.</li>
<li>We select $p&lt;1/3$ so that a third of symbols and also slivers may be used to reconstruct the blob
by the <strong>decode algorithm</strong>. The matrix used to produce the erasure code is fixed and the same
for all blobs by the Walrus system, and encoders have no discretion about it.</li>
<li>Storage nodes manage one or more shards, and corresponding sliver of each blob are distributed
to all the storage shards. As a result, the overhead of the distributed store is ~5x that of
the blob itself, no matter how many shards we have. The encoding is systematic meaning that some
storage nodes hold part of the plain blob, allowing for fast random access reads.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each blob is also associated with some metadata including a blob ID to allow verification:</p>
<ul>
<li>A blob ID is computed as an authenticator of the set of all shard data and metadata (byte size,
encoding, blob hash). We hash a sliver representation in each of the shards and add the resulting
hashes into a Merkle tree. Then the root of the Merkle tree is the blob hash used to derive the
blob ID that identifies the blob in the system.</li>
<li>Each storage node may use the blob ID to check if some shard data belongs to a blob using the
authenticated structure corresponding to the blob hash (Merkle tree). A successful check means
that the data is indeed as intended by the writer of the blob (who, remember, may be corrupt).</li>
<li>When any party reconstructs a blob ID from shards data and slivers, or accepts any blob purporting
to be a specific blob ID, it must check that it encodes to the correct blob ID. This process
involves re-coding the blob using the erasure correction code, and re-deriving the blob ID to
check the blob indeed matches it. This prevents a malformed blob (i.e., incorrectly erasure coded)
from ever being read with a blob ID at any correct recipient.</li>
<li>A set of slivers above the reconstruction threshold belonging to a blob ID that are either
inconsistent or lead to the reconstruction of a different ID represent an incorrect encoding
(this may happen if the user that encoded the blob was malicious and encoded it incorrectly).
Storage nodes may delete slivers belonging to inconsistently encoded blobs, and upon request
return an inconsistency proof.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="operations"><a class="header" href="#operations">Operations</a></h1>
<p>Walrus operations can be separated in <a href="./operations-sui.html">interactions with the Sui chain</a>, which
is used by Walrus for coordination and governance, and <a href="./operations-off-chain.html">off-chain
interactions</a> between clients and storage nodes.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="operations-on-sui"><a class="header" href="#operations-on-sui">Operations on Sui</a></h1>
<p>Walrus uses Sui smart contracts to coordinate storage operations as resources that have a lifetime,
and payments. As well as to facilitate governance to determine the storage nodes holding each
storage shard. We outline here these operations and refer to them below as part of the read / write
paths. As a reminder, only blob metadata is ever exposed to Sui or its validators, and the content
of blobs is always stored off-chain on Walrus storage nodes and caches. The storage nodes or caches
do not have to overlap with any Sui infra (validators etc), and the storage epochs may be of
different lengths and not have the same start / end times as Sui epochs.</p>
<h2 id="storage-resource-life-cycle-on-sui"><a class="header" href="#storage-resource-life-cycle-on-sui">Storage resource life cycle on Sui</a></h2>
<p>A number of Sui smart contracts hold the metadata of the Walrus system and all its entities.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>Walrus system object</strong> holds the committee of storage nodes for the current storage epoch. The
system object also holds the total available space on Walrus and the price per unit of storage (1
KiB). These values are determined by 2/3 agreement between the storage nodes for the storage
epoch. Users can pay to purchase storage space for some time duration. These space resources may
be split, merged and transferred. Later they can be used to place a blob ID into Walrus.</li>
<li>The <strong>storage fund</strong> holds funds for storing blobs over one, multiple storage epochs or
perpetually. When purchasing storage space from the system object users pay into the storage fund
separated over multiple storage epochs, and payments are made each epoch to storage nodes
according to performance (see below).</li>
<li>A user acquires some storage through the contracts or transfer, and can assign to it a blob ID,
signifying they wish to store this blob ID into it. This emits a Move <strong>resource event</strong> that
both caches and storage nodes listen to to expect and authorize off-chain storage operations.</li>
<li>Eventually a user holds an off-chain <strong>availability certificate</strong> from storage nodes for a blob
ID. The user <strong>uploads the certificate on chain</strong> to signal that the blob ID is available for an
availability period. The certificate is checked against the latest Walrus committee,
and an <strong>availability event</strong> is emitted for the blob ID if correct. This is the PoA for the
blob.</li>
<li>In case a blob ID is not correctly encoded a <strong>inconsistency proof certificate</strong> may be uploaded
on chain at a later time, and an <strong>inconsistent blob event</strong> is emitted signaling to all that the
blob ID read results will always return None. This indicates that its slivers may be deleted by
storage nodes, except for an indicator to return None.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users writing to Walrus, need to perform Sui transactions to acquire storage and certify blobs.
Users creating or consuming proofs for attestations of blob availability read the chain
only to prove or verify emission of events. A node that reads Walrus resources only needs to read
the blockchain to get committee metadata once per epoch, and then they request slivers directly
from storage nodes by blob ID to perform reads.</p>
<h2 id="governance-operations-on-sui"><a class="header" href="#governance-operations-on-sui">Governance operations on Sui</a></h2>
<p>Each Walrus storage epoch is represented by the Walrus system object that contains a storage
committee and various metadata or storage nodes like the mapping between shards and storage nodes,
available space and current costs. User may go to the system object for the period and <strong>buy some
storage</strong> amount for one or more storage epochs. At each storage epoch there is a price for storage,
and the payment provided becomes part of a <strong>storage fund</strong> for all the storage epochs that span
the storage bought. There is a maximum number of storage epochs in the future for which storage can
be bought (~2 years). Storage is a resource that can be split and merged, and transferred.</p>
<p>At the end of the storage epoch part of the funds in the <strong>storage fund need to be allocated to
storage nodes</strong>. The idea here is for storage nodes to perform light audits of each others,
and suggest which nodes are to be paid based on the performance of these audits.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="off-chain-operations"><a class="header" href="#off-chain-operations">Off-chain operations</a></h1>
<p>Walrus operations happen off Sui, but may interact with the Sui flows defining the resource life
cycle.</p>
<h2 id="write-paths"><a class="header" href="#write-paths">Write paths</a></h2>
<p><img src="assets/WriteFlow.png" alt="Write paths of Walrus" /></p>
<p>Systems overview of writes, illustrated above:</p>
<ul>
<li>A user acquires a storage resource of appropriate size and duration on-chain, either by directly
buying it on the Walrus system object, or a secondary market. A user can split, merge, and
transfer storage acquired storage resources.</li>
<li>When a user wants to write a blob, it first erasure codes it using encode, and computes its
blob ID. Then they can perform the following steps itself, or use a publisher to perform steps
on their behalf.</li>
<li>The user goes on chain (Sui) and updates a storage resource to register the blob ID with the
appropriate size and lifetime desired. This emits an event, received by storage nodes. Once the
user receives it then continues the upload.</li>
<li>The user sends each of the blob slivers and metadata to the storage nodes that currently
manages the corresponding shards.</li>
<li>A storage node managing a shard receives a sliver and checks it against the blob ID of the overall
blob. It also checks that there is a blob resource with that blob ID that is authorized to store
a blob. If correct, then it signs a statement that it holds the sliver for blob ID (and metadata)
and returns it to the user.</li>
<li>The user puts together the signatures returned from storage nodes into an availability certificate
and sends it on chain. When successfully checked an availability event for the blob ID is emitted,
and all other storage nodes seek to download any missing shards for the blob ID. This event being
emitted on Sui is the Point of Availability (PoA) for the blob ID.</li>
<li>After the PoA, and without user involvement, storage nodes sync and recover any missing slivers
that are certified.</li>
</ul>
<p>The user waits for 2/3 of shards signatures to return a certificate of availability. The rate of the
code is below 1/3 allowing for reconstruction if even 1/3 of shards only return the sliver. Since at
most 1/3 of the storage nodes can fail, this ensures reconstruction if a reader requests slivers
from all storage nodes that have signed the ID of the blob. Note that the full process can be
mediated by a publisher, that receives a blob and drives the process to completion.</p>
<h2 id="refresh-availability"><a class="header" href="#refresh-availability">Refresh availability</a></h2>
<p>Since no content data is required to refresh the period of storage, refresh is conducted fully on
chain within the protocol. To request an extension to the availability period of a blob, a user
provides an appropriate storage resource. Upon success this emits an event that storage nodes
receive to extend the period each sliver is stored for.</p>
<h2 id="inconsistent-resource-flow"><a class="header" href="#inconsistent-resource-flow">Inconsistent resource flow</a></h2>
<p>When a correct storage node tries to reconstruct a shard it may fail if the encoding of a blob ID
past PoA was incorrect, and will be able to extract an inconsistency proof for the blob ID. It then
generates a inconsistency certificate and uploads it on chain. The flow is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A storage node fails to reconstruct a shard, and generates an inconsistency proof.</li>
<li>The storage node sends the blob ID and inconsistency proof to all storage nodes of the storage
epoch, and gets a signature, that it aggregates to an inconsistency certificate.</li>
<li>The storage node sends the inconsistency certificate to the Walrus smart contract, that checks it
and emits a inconsistent resource event.</li>
<li>Upon receiving a inconsistent resource event correct storage nodes delete sliver data and only
keep a metadata record to return None for the blob ID for the availability period. No storage
attestation challenges are issued for this blob ID.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that a blob ID that is inconsistent will always resolve to None upon reading: this is due to
the read process running the decoding algorithm, and then re-encoding to check the blob ID is
correctly derived from a consistent encoding. This means that an inconsistency proof only reveals a
true fact to storage nodes (that may not otherwise have ran decoding), and does not change the
output of read in any case.</p>
<p>Note however that partial reads leveraging the systematic nature of the encoding may return partial
reads for inconsistently encoded files. Thus if consistency and availability of reads is important
dapps should do full reads rather than partial reads.</p>
<h2 id="read-paths"><a class="header" href="#read-paths">Read paths</a></h2>
<p>A user can read stored blobs either directly or through a cache. We discuss here the direct user
journey since this is also the operation of the cache in case of a cache miss. We assume that most
reads will happen through caches, for blobs that are hot, and will not result in requests to
storage nodes.</p>
<ul>
<li>The reader gets the metadata for the blob ID from any storage node, and authenticates it using
the blob ID.</li>
<li>The reader then sends a request for the shards corresponding to blob ID to storage nodes, and
waits for f+1 to respond. Sufficient requests are sent in parallel to ensure low latency for
reads.</li>
<li>The reader authenticates the slivers returned with the blob ID, reconstructs the blob, and decides
whether the contents are a valid blob or inconsistent.</li>
<li>Optionally, for a cache, the result is cached and can be served without re-construction for some
time, until it is removed from the cache. Requests for the blob to the cache return the blob
contents, or a proof the blob is inconsistently encoded.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="challenge-mechanism-for-storage-attestation"><a class="header" href="#challenge-mechanism-for-storage-attestation">Challenge mechanism for storage attestation</a></h2>
<p>During an epoch a correct storage node challenges all shards to provide blob slivers past PoA:</p>
<ul>
<li>The list of available blobs for the period is determined by the sequence of Sui events up
to the past period. Inconsistent blobs are not challenged, and a record proving this status
can be returned instead.</li>
<li>A challenge sequence is determined by providing a seed to the challenged shard. The sequence is
then computed based both on the seed AND the content of each challenged blob ID. This creates a
sequential read dependency.</li>
<li>The response to the challenge provides the sequence of shard contents for the blob IDs in a
timely manner.</li>
<li>The challenger node uses thresholds to determine whether the challenge was passed, and reports
the result on chain.</li>
<li>The challenge / response communication is authenticated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Challenges provide some reassurance that the storage node actually can recover shard data in a
probabilistic manner, avoiding storage nodes getting payment without any evidence they may retrieve
shard data. The sequential nature of the challenge and some reasonable timeout also ensure that
the process is timely.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="future-discussion"><a class="header" href="#future-discussion">Future discussion</a></h1>
<p>In this document, we left out details of the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shard transfer and recovery upon storage epoch change. The encoding scheme used has been designed
to allow this operation to be efficient. A storage node needs to only get data of the same
magnitude to the missing sliver data to reconstruct them.</li>
<li>Details of light clients that can be used to sample availability. Individual clients may sample
the certified blobs from Sui metadata, and sample the availability of some slivers that they
store. On-chain bounties may be used to retrieve these slivers for missing blobs.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="interacting-with-walrus"><a class="header" href="#interacting-with-walrus">Interacting with Walrus</a></h1>
<p>We provide 3 ways to interact directly with the Walrus storage system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Through the walrus <a href="client-cli.html">client command line interface (CLI)</a>.</li>
<li>Through a <a href="json-api.html">JSON API</a> of the walrus CLI.</li>
<li>Through an <a href="web-api.html">HTTP API</a> exposed by the walrus client daemon.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="using-the-walrus-client"><a class="header" href="#using-the-walrus-client">Using the Walrus client</a></h1>
<p>The <code>walrus</code> binary can be used to interact with Walrus as a client. To use it, you need a Walrus
configuration and a Sui wallet.
Detailed usage information is available through</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">walrus --help
</code></pre>
<p>Storing and reading blobs from Walrus can be achieved through the following commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">CONFIG=working_dir/client_config.yaml # adjust for your configuration file
walrus -c $CONFIG store &lt;some file&gt; # store a file
walrus -c $CONFIG read &lt;some blob ID&gt; # read a blob
</code></pre>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="json-mode"><a class="header" href="#json-mode">JSON mode</a></h1>
<p>All Walrus client commands (except, currently, the <code>info</code> command) are available in JSON mode.
In this mode, all the command line flags of the original CLI command can be specified in JSON
format. The JSON mode therefore simplifies programmatic access to the CLI.</p>
<p>For example, to store a blob, run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">walrus json \
    '{
        "config": "working_dir/client_config.yaml",
        "command": {
            "store": {
                "file": "README.md"
            }
        }
    }'
</code></pre>
<p>or, to read a blob knowing the blob ID:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">walrus json \
    '{
        "config": "working_dir/client_config.yaml",
        "command": {
            "read": {
                "blob_id": "4BKcDC0Ih5RJ8R0tFMz3MZVNZV8b2goT6_JiEEwNHQo"
            }
        }
    }'
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>json</code> command also accepts input from <code>stdin</code>.</p>
<p>The output of a <code>json</code> command will itself be JSON-formatted, again to simplify parsing the results
in a programmatic way. For example, the JSON output can be piped to the <code>jq</code> command for parsing and
manually extracting relevant fields.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="client-daemon-mode--http-api"><a class="header" href="#client-daemon-mode--http-api">Client Daemon mode &amp; HTTP API</a></h1>
<p>In addition to the CLI mode, the Walrus client offers a <em>daemon mode</em>. In this mode, it runs a
simple web server offering HTTP interfaces to store and read blobs.</p>
<h2 id="starting-the-daemon"><a class="header" href="#starting-the-daemon">Starting the daemon</a></h2>
<p>You can run the daemon with
different sets of API endpoints through one of the following commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">ADDRESS="127.0.0.1:31415" # bind the daemon to localhost and port 31415
walrus -c $CONFIG aggregator -b $ADDRESS # run an aggregator to read blobs
walrus -c $CONFIG publisher -b $ADDRESS # run a publisher to store blobs
walrus -c $CONFIG daemon -b $ADDRESS # run a daemon combining an aggregator and a publisher
</code></pre>
<p>The aggregator provides all read APIs, the publisher all the store APIs, and daemon provides both.
Note that the aggregator does not perform Sui on-chain actions, and therefore consumes no gas.
However, the publisher does perform actions on-chain and will consume gas. It is therefore important
to ensure only authorized parties may access it, or other measures to manage gas costs.</p>
<h2 id="http-api-usage"><a class="header" href="#http-api-usage">HTTP API Usage</a></h2>
<p>You can then interact with the daemon through simple HTTP requests. For example, with
<a href="https://curl.se">cURL</a>, you can store blobs as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">curl -X PUT "http://$ADDRESS/v1/store" -d "some string" # store the string `some string` for 1 storage epoch
curl -X PUT "http://$ADDRESS/v1/store?epochs=5" -d @"some/file" # store file `some/file` for 5 storage epochs
</code></pre>
<p>Blobs may be read using the following cURL command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">curl "http://$ADDRESS/v1/&lt;some blob ID&gt;" # read a blob from Walrus (with aggregator or daemon)
</code></pre>
<p>Modern browsers will attempt to sniff the content type for such resources, and will generally do a
good job of inferring content types for media. However, the aggregator on purpose prevents such
sniffing from inferring dangerous executable types such as javascript or style sheet types.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="introduction-to-walrus-sites"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-walrus-sites">Introduction to Walrus Sites</a></h1>
<p><em>Walrus Sites</em> are "web"-sites that use Sui and Walrus as their underlying technology. They are a
prime example of how Walrus can be used to build new and exciting decentralized applications. Anyone
can build and deploy a Walrus Site, and make it accessible to the World!</p>
<p>At a high level, the most exciting features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing a site does not require managing servers or complex configurations; just provide the
source files (produced by your favorite web framework), publish them to Walrus Sites using the
<a href="walrus-sites/./site-builder.html">site builder tool</a>, and you are done!</li>
<li>Sites can be linked to from ordinary Sui objects. This feature enables, for example, creating a
NFT collection in which <em>every single NFT</em> has a <em>personalized website dedicated to it</em>.</li>
<li>Walrus Sites are owned by addresses on Sui, and can be exchanged, shared, and updated thanks to
Sui's flexible programming model. This means, among other things, that Walrus Sites can leverage
the <a href="https://suins.io/">SuiNS</a> naming system to have human readable names. No more messing around
with DNS!</li>
<li>Thanks to Walrus' decentralization and extremely high data availability, there is no risk of
having your site wiped for no reason.</li>
<li>Since they live on Walrus, these sites cannot have a backend in the traditional sense, and can be
therefore considered "static" sites. However, the developer can harness Sui's programmability
to add backend functionality to Walrus Sites!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="show-me"><a class="header" href="#show-me">Show me</a></h2>
<p>To give you a very high level intuition of how Walrus Sites work, let's look at an example: A simple
NFT collection on Sui, that has a frontend dApp to mint the NFTs hosted on Walrus Sites, and in
which <em>each NFT</em> has a <em>specific, personalized Walrus Site</em>.</p>
<p>You can check out the mint page at
<a href="https://flatland.walrus.site/">https://flatland.walrus.site/</a>. This site is serve to your browser
through the Walrus Site <em>Portal</em> <a href="https://walrus.site">https://walrus.site</a>. While the Portal's
operation is explained in a <a href="walrus-sites/./portal.html">later section</a>, consider for now that there
can be many Portals (hosted by whomever wants to have their own, and even on <code>localhost</code>). Further,
the only function of the Portal is to provide the browser with some code (specifically, a service
worker) that allows it to fetch the Walrus Site from Sui and Walrus.</p>
<p>If you have a Sui wallet with some Testnet SUI, you can try and "mint a new Flatlander" from the
site. This creates an NFT from the collection, and shows you two links, one to the explorer, and one
to the "Flatlander site". This latter site is a special Walrus Site that exists only for that NFT,
and has special characteristics (the background color, the image...) that are based on the contents
of the NFT.</p>
<p>The URL to this per-NFT site look something like this
<code>https://4egmmrw9izzjn0dm2lkd3k0l8phk386z60ub1tpdc1jswbb5dr.walrus.site/</code>.  You'll notice that the
domain remains <code>walrus.site</code>, but the subdomain is a long and random-looking string.  This string is
actually the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base36">Base36</a> encoding of the object ID of the NFT,
which is
<a href="https://suiscan.xyz/testnet/object/0xb09b312b28049467dd6173b6cebb60ed5fe3046883e248632bf9fb20b7dbdaff">0xb09b312b...</a>.</p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walrus Sites are served through a Portal; in this case, <code>https://walrus.site</code>. There can be many
Portals, and anyone can host one.</li>
<li>The subdomain on the URL points to a specific object on Sui, that allows the browser to fetch and
render the site resources. This pointer can be:
<ul>
<li>A SuiNS name, such as <code>flatland</code> in <code>https://flatland.walrus.site</code>; or</li>
<li>the Base36 encoding of a the Sui object ID, such as <code>0xb09b312b...</code> in the example above.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Have a recent version of <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">Rust</a> installed; and</li>
<li>have the <a href="https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install">Sui CLI</a> installed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, follow these additional setup steps.</p>
<h2 id="get-the-walrus-binary-and-install-it"><a class="header" href="#get-the-walrus-binary-and-install-it">Get the <code>walrus</code> binary and install it</a></h2>
<p>Download the latest <code>walrus</code> binary for your architecture from
<code>https://storage.googleapis.com/mysten-walrus-binaries/walrus-v0.1.0-a0fb8c9-&lt;arch&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;arch&gt;</code>
is your architecture. The available options are listed in this table:</p>

</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Then, add it to your <code>$PATH</code>. For example, on MacOS you can copy it to
<code>/Users/myusername/.local/bin/</code> (check what directories are in your <code>$PATH</code> by running <code>echo $PATH</code>).</p>
<p>Once this is done, you should be able to type <code>walrus</code> in your terminal and see:</p>

<p>If, for any reason, you don't want to add <code>walrus</code> to <code>$PATH</code>, place the binary in your preferred
directory, and remember to configure a pointer to the binary in the <code>site-builder</code> config (more on
this <a href="walrus-sites/./tutorial-config.html">later</a>).</p>

<p>If the <code>active</code> network is not <code>testnet</code>, switch to <code>testnet</code> by running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">sui client switch --envs testnet

<p>Further, make sure you have at least 2 separate gas coins, with at least 1 SUI each, by running <code>sui client gas</code>.  If you don't have enough SUI, you can hit the testnet faucet by running.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">sui client faucet --url https://faucet.testnet.sui.io/v1/gas

<h2 id="select-the-source-material-for-the-site"><a class="header" href="#select-the-source-material-for-the-site">Select the source material for the site</a></h2>
<p>The <code>site-builder</code> works by uploading a directory of files produced by any web framework to Walrus,
and adding the relevant metadata to Sui. This directory should have a file called <code>index.html</code> in
its root, which will be the entry point to the Walrus Site.</p>
<p>For the rest of the tutorial, we will use as an example the simple site contained in
<code>./examples/snake</code>.</p>
<h2 id="publish-the-site"><a class="header" href="#publish-the-site">Publish the site</a></h2>
<p>Since we have placed the <code>walrus</code> binary and configuration in their default locations, publishing
the <code>./examples/snake</code> site is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ensure that you are in the <code>site-builder</code> directory;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the publishing command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./target/release/site-builder --config assets/builder-example.yaml publish ../examples/snake

</ul>
<p>The output should look like the following:</p>

<p>This output tells you that, for each file in the folder, a new Walrus blob was created, and the
respective blob ID.  Further it prints the object ID of the Walrus Site object on Sui (so you can
have a look in the explorer, and use it to set the SuiNS name), and, finally, the URL at which you
can browse the site.</p>
<p>Note here that we are passing the example config <code>assets/builder-example.yaml</code> as the config for the
site builder. The configuration file is necessary to ensure that the <code>site-builder</code> knows the
correct Sui package for the Walrus Sites logic.</p>
<p>More details on the configuration of the <code>site-builder</code> can be found under the <a href="walrus-sites/tutorial-config.html">advanced
configuration</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="update-the-site"><a class="header" href="#update-the-site">Update the site</a></h2>
<p>Let's say now you want to update the content of the site, for example by changing the title from
"eat all the blobs!" to "Glob all the Blobs!".</p>
<p>First, make this edit on in the <code>../examples/snake/index.html</code> file.</p>
<p>Then, you can update the existing site by running the <code>update</code> command, and providing the directory
where to find the updated files (still <code>../example/snake</code>), and the object ID of the existing site
(<code>0x5ac988...</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./target/release/site-builder --config assets/builder-example.yaml update ../examples/snake 0x5ac9888...

<p>Browsing to the provided URL should reflect the change. You've updated the site!</p>
<h2 id="additional-commands"><a class="header" href="#additional-commands">Additional commands</a></h2>
<p>The <code>site-builder</code> tool provides two additional utilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>convert</code> command, which converts an object ID in hex format to the equivalent Base36
format. This command is useful if you have the Sui object ID of a Walrus Site, and want to know
the subdomain where you can browse it.</li>
<li>the <code>sitemap</code> command, which shows the resources that compose the Walrus Site at the given object
ID.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, the <code>--help</code> flag is your friend!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="bonus-set-a-suins-name"><a class="header" href="#bonus-set-a-suins-name">Bonus: Set a SuiNS name</a></h1>
<p>Browsing a URL like <code>https://29gjzk8yjl1v7zm2etee1siyzaqfj9jaru5ufs6yyh1yqsgun2.walrus.site</code> is not
particularly nice. Therefore, Walrus Sites allows to use SuiNS names (this is like DNS for Sui) to
give human-readable names to site. To do so, you simply have to get a SuiNS name you like, and point
it to the object ID of the Walrus Site (as provided by the <code>publish</code> or <code>update</code> commands).</p>
<p>Let's do this step by step.</p>
<h2 id="get-a-suins-name"><a class="header" href="#get-a-suins-name">Get a SuiNS name</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to <a href="https://testnet.suins.io/">https://testnet.suins.io/</a>, and buy a domain name with
your testnet wallet. For example, <code>walrusgame</code> (NOTE: this is already taken, choose another you
like!). NOTE: At the moment, you can only select names that are composed of letters <code>a-z</code> and
numbers <code>0-9</code>, but no special characters (e.g., <code>-</code>).</li>
<li>In the <a href="https://testnet.suins.io/account/my-names">page</a> listing the domains you own, you should
see the newly-bought name.</li>
<li>Click the three-dots menu on the top-right corner of the name you want to assign. Choose "View all
info", and copy the <code>ObjectID</code>. In our case, this is
<code>0x6412c4cfbe50e219c2d4d30108d7321d064e15bf64e752307100bff5eb91da38</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="send-the-suins-registration-object-to-the-address-you-use-with-the-sui-cli"><a class="header" href="#send-the-suins-registration-object-to-the-address-you-use-with-the-sui-cli">Send the SuiNS registration object to the address you use with the Sui CLI</a></h2>
<p>The steps that follow require that the SuiNS registration object is owned by the address you are
using on the Sui CLI. Therefore, we need to send this registration object from the address you use
in your browser wallet, to the address of your Sui CLI.</p>
<p>To find the Sui CLI address, execute:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">sui client active-address
</code></pre>
<p>Then, from your browser wallet, select the "Assets" tab, and look for the NFT of the SuiNS
registration, which should look as follows:</p>
<p><img src="walrus-sites/../assets/suins-asset.png" alt="the SuiNS registration inside the wallet" /></p>
<p>Click on it, scroll down to "Send NFT", and send it to the address discovered with the command
above. Now, your Sui CLI address owns the registration NFT, and you can proceed to the next step.</p>
<h2 id="map-the-suins-name-to-the-walrus-site"><a class="header" href="#map-the-suins-name-to-the-walrus-site">Map the SuiNS name to the Walrus Site</a></h2>
<p>This step associates the name <code>walrusgame</code> to the object ID of our Walrus Site. There are possibly
many ways to achieve this, and as the SuiNS UI improves this could be done from the webapp as well.</p>
<p>Here, we issue an transaction using the Sui CLI that creates this mapping.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"> sui client call \
    --package 0x22fa05f21b1ad71442491220bb9338f7b7095fe35000ef88d5400d28523bdd93 \
    --module controller \
    --function set_target_address \
    --gas-budget 500000000 \
    --args 0x300369e8909b9a6464da265b9a5a9ab6fe2158a040e84e808628cde7a07ee5a3 \

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="configuring-the-site-builder"><a class="header" href="#configuring-the-site-builder">Configuring the site builder</a></h1>
<p>Configuring the <code>site-builder</code> tool is straightforward, but care is required to ensure that
everything works correctly.</p>
<p>The <code>site-builder</code> tool requires a configuration file to know which package to use on Sui, which
wallet to use, the gas budget, and other operational details. Most of these are abstracted away
through sensible defaults, so you should not need to touch them. Yet, for completeness, we provide
here the details for all the configuration options.</p>
<h2 id="minimal-configuration"><a class="header" href="#minimal-configuration">Minimal configuration</a></h2>
<p>The config file is expected to be in <code>./builder.yaml</code>, and it is possible to point elsewhere with
the <code>--config</code> flag.  For your first run, it should be sufficient to call the <code>site-builder</code> with
<code>--config assets/builder-example.yaml</code>, which is already configured appropriately.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-configuration"><a class="header" href="#advanced-configuration">Advanced configuration</a></h2>
<p>If you want to have more control over the behavior of the site builder, you can customize the
following variables in the config file:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>package</code>: the object ID of the Walrus Sites package on Sui. This must always be specified in the
config, and is already appropriately configured in <code>assets/example-config.yaml</code>.</li>
<li><code>portal</code>: the name of the Portal through which the site will be viewed; this only affects the
output of the CLI, and nothing else (default: <code>walrus.site</code>).
All Walrus Sites are accessible through any Portal independent of this setting.</li>
<li><code>general</code>: these are general options, that can be configured both through the CLI and the config:
<ul>
<li><code>rpc_url</code>: The URL of the Sui RPC node to use. If not set, the <code>site-builder</code> will infer it from
the wallet.</li>
<li><code>wallet</code>: Pointer to the Sui wallet to be used. By default, it uses the system-wide wallet (the
one from <code>sui client addresses</code>).</li>
<li><code>walrus_binary</code>: Pointer to the <code>walrus</code> binary. By default, this is expected to be run from
<code>$PATH</code>.</li>
<li><code>walrus_config</code>: The configuration for the <code>walrus</code> client binary. See the relative
documentation (TODO: link).</li>
<li><code>gas_budget</code>: The maximum amount of gas to be spent for transactions (default: 500M MIST).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Walrus Sites can be used to deploy almost any form of traditional static "Web 2" website build for
modern browsers. There are, however, a number of restrictions that a developer should keep in mind
when creating or porting a website to Walrus Sites.</p>
<h2 id="no-secret-values"><a class="header" href="#no-secret-values">No secret values</a></h2>
<p>Walrus Sites are fully publicly accessible, as the metadata is stored on Sui and the site content is
stored on Walrus. Therefore, developers <em>must</em> not store secret values within the sites.</p>
<p>We emphasize again that any such backend-specific operations (storing secret values, authentication,
etc.) are achievable by leveraging the integration with Sui blockchain and the Sui wallet.</p>
<h2 id="there-is-a-maximum-redirect-depth"><a class="header" href="#there-is-a-maximum-redirect-depth">There is a maximum redirect depth</a></h2>
<p>The number of consecutive redirects a Walrus Site can perform is capped by the
Portal (see <a href="walrus-sites/./portal.html">Portal configuration</a>).  This measure ensures that loading a Walrus Site
does not result in an infinite loading loop.</p>
<p>Different Portals can set this limit as they desire. The limit for the Portal hosted at
<a href="http://walrus.site">walrus.site</a> has a maximum redirect depth of 3.</p>
<h2 id="service-workers-are-not-available"><a class="header" href="#service-workers-are-not-available">Service workers are not available</a></h2>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: This limitation only applies to Portal based on service workers. A web Portal will not
have this limitation.</p>
<p>Walrus Sites leverage service workers in the clients' browsers to perform these essential
operations:</p>
<ol>
<li>reading the site metadata from Sui;</li>
<li>fetching the page content from Walrus; and</li>
<li>serving the content to the browser.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, a site deployed on Walrus Sites cannot use service workers. Installing a service worker
from within a Walrus Site will result in a dysfunctional site and a poor experience for the user.</p>
<h2 id="the-ios-sui-wallet-mobile-does-not-work-with-walrus-sites"><a class="header" href="#the-ios-sui-wallet-mobile-does-not-work-with-walrus-sites">The iOS Sui Wallet Mobile does not work with Walrus Sites</a></h2>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: This limitation only applies to Portal based on service workers. A web Portal will not
have this limitation.</p>
<p>Service workers cannot be loaded inside an in-app browser on iOS, because of a limitation of the
WebKit engine. As a consequence, Walrus Sites cannot be used within the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sui-wallet-mobile/id6476572140">Sui Wallet
Mobile</a> app on iOS, and therefore
the Sui wallet can currently not be used on a Walrus Site on iOS. Note, however, that <em>browsing</em> a
Walrus Site is still possible on iOS through any browser. Only the connection to the wallet is
impacted.</p>
<p>The connection with the Sui Wallet Mobile app works on Android devices.</p>
